&lt;br /&gt;
To the SSB Council:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have been wracking my brain trying to think of some way to turn the upcoming vote on the Ernst Mayr Award from a divisive into a uniting event for the society. Currently, the problem we face is that a major group of members will feel disenfranchised, no matter which way the vote goes. No one wants that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;I think I’ve come up with a solution that everyone can support, and that will unite all sides. The primary motivation for changing the name of the award is to avoid any exclusion of applications from students from historically underrepresented groups. And yet, removing the name clearly offends many members who admire the outstanding contributions and service of Mayr to SSB and society in general, including his lifetime efforts to make systematics and society more welcoming for all. The latter group includes many student members, as well as members who knew and admired Mayr in life. Both groups are motivated by reasonable concerns, and everyone seems to want to make SSB more welcoming for all.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  
My proposal has two parts: (1) change the name of the award given for the outstanding paper presented at the Annual Meeting by a student member to the Outstanding Student Presentation Award, as in the existing proposal; and (2) change the purpose and mechanism of awarding the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology, to a new award that is selected by committee, without any applications. The new award could be fashioned as a “Nobel Prize in Systematics,” or it could be an award for exemplary service to the society. But there would be no applications, and thus no feeling of exclusion by any potential applicants. Ernst Mayr would continue to be recognized for his important contributions and generous gift to the society’s endowment, and the Outstanding Student Presentation Award would remove any bias from student applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
  
This solution seems to meet the stated goals of all sides, and includes and welcomes all members of the society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope that the Council will consider this uniting solution, as I fear that the vote will otherwise divide the society, no matter the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

(Jim) Crow, Professor in the Department of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who had been 
a mentor of mine and of many other population geneticists.  Subsequently UW/Madison established the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://genetics.wisc.edu/the-j-f-crow-institute-for-the-study-of-evolution/&quot;&gt;JF Crow Institute for the Study of Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.  Subsequently it has been pointed out that he 
had a connection to eugenics, and there is now serious consideration of removing his name from the eponymous Institute.  The debate is within the UW/M community, and outside opinions 
have not been solicited, and are possibly not welcome.  I am told that the matter will most likely be decided on January 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim was a major influence on me, and I think I also have some insight into his thinking on eugenics.  So it seems appropriate for me to put some thoughts here, to make 
them available to those who want to know who Jim was and what his views were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim (James F.) Crow was my undergraduate supervisor, to whom I am immensely grateful.  In 1961 he encouraged me to hang out in his lab, where I met many population geneticists including Motoo Kimura.  He supervised my Honors Thesis in 1964, which later became my first
sole-authored paper.  When I was thinking about graduate school he asked whether I would consider becoming his graduate student.  I said that he had influenced me greatly, but I wanted to experience other
influences, so I should go elsewhere.  He said there was an interesting young population geneticist Dick Lewontin, and he then arranged for me to spend the summer of 1963 as a student programmer in
Dick Lewontin’s lab (then at the University of Rochester).  That ultimately resulted in me getting my Ph.D. with Dick at the University of Chicago.  For that and more, I am grateful.  Jim played similar
roles with many other theoretical population geneticists and has many people who consider themselves in his debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim considered his own mentor to be H.J. Muller.  In the period after World War II, Muller (the greatest classical geneticist, who proved that radiation could cause mutations) felt that in spite of the catastrophe of Nazi eugenics, that there could be a “good” eugenics, so that humans could direct their own genetic change.  Jim tended to agree with Muller about that.  Their concern was with matters such as the spread of deleterious mutations, Muller’s chief concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its early days, the focus of eugenics had been largely on class rather than race, making sure that the working class did not out-reproduce their rulers.  Eugenicists were hereditarians, who tended to explain differences between humans as likely being genetic (biologists more generally often have that tendency to forget about cultural and social influences on people in their eagerness to point to the importance of biology).  Eugenicists actually did not talk much about “race” but their hereditarian attitude implied biological-determinist views on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim was involved with the quantitative genetics theory used in animal and
plant breeding.  He knew that differences could be either environmental or genetic, and that one could not always tell.  He came from a Quaker family and was politically quite liberal, and of course supported the civil rights movement, 
but he did want to keep the door open for
there to be a “good” eugenics.  Student organizations at the University of Wisconsin had to have faculty advisors listed.  One year, I heard, the NAACP chapter on
campus had asked Jim Crow to be their advisor, which he agreed to.  I think they and Jim just thought it was a good joke.  When the race-and-IQ controversies flared up in 1969 after Arthur
Jensen’s article, I think Jim was ambivalent.  He did not want to totally rule out explaining differences between groups of humans genetically.  He neither defended nor attacked Jensen.  When the issue came up of having the Genetics Society of America 
 pass a resolution dissociating itself from Jensen he was not among those of us who felt it was important to pass a firmly-stated resolution.  Ultimately the GSA passed a resolution so carefully nuanced 
that it had no impact on the public perception of geneticists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should the Crow Institute be renamed?  Abolished?  Defunded? Condemned?  Forgotten? Apologized for?  Wept about? Held up as a Horrible Example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Jim had a large positive effect on the development and understanding of evolutionary theory, both in his theoretical work,
his excellent teaching, his clear writing, and his mentorship of many people.  I think there is very good reason to commemorate him.  But people are complex, and
Jim was no exception.    We all have a tendency to erect heroes and forget that they can have flaws.  We have to guard against idealizing
the people we remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious issue is not who gets what named after them, but how we are to discuss the history of population genetics, including discussing the contributions 
of individuals to the field.  Will the methodology simply be to look for something unacceptable that a contributor has said, declare that 
“of course, we must not judge people by today’s standards”, and then proceed to do precisely that, judge the person by today’s standards?  That 
seems to be what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note that in the Institute’s statement about renaming it was said that “some of us have a deep appreciation for his career and/or considered him a dear friend, whereas others are only beginning to learn about Professor Crow through this controversy”. Unless some way is found to honestly discuss the history of population genetics, the people who are “only beginning” will never get any further in their learning of the history of the field.  If only ideal people can be remembered, then we will have to spend a lot of time and effort forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent the other day sent us a link to an article with this intriguing title, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2022-01-rationality-declined-decades.html&quot;&gt;‘We conclude’ or ‘I believe?’ Study finds rationality declined decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. The study, out of Wageningen and Indiana Universities, suggests that since 1980 public interest has shifted from rationality toward emotion. Those who think we are in a “post-truth” era will not be surprised. It seems to me that this trend, if substantiated, shows that we may be veering away from scientific thinking and evidence to unfounded opinions and unsubstantiated claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above, which does not appear in the paper, leaves something to be desired: We are not told the units of the vertical axes. I am going to guess that they are standard deviations of something. No matter, we can get the drift; from 1850 to 1980, rationality words increased steadily in frequency, whereas intuition words decreased. From 1980 to now, by contrast, rationality words have decreased sharply while intuition words have increased sharply. The figure gives a handful of each type of word (note that “think” and “truth” are counted as intuition words). The dashed line represents the frequency with which the word “facebook” appears; I do not know why it is not quite 0 for the first 150 years of its nonexistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer&quot;&gt;Google nGram&lt;/a&gt; data, the researchers analyzed the language in millions of books and, in the words of the Phys.org article,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;found that words associated with reasoning, such as &quot;determine&quot; and &quot;conclusion,&quot; rose systematically beginning in 1850, while words related to human experience such as &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;believe&quot; declined. This pattern has reversed over the past 40 years, paralleled by a shift from a collectivistic to an individualistic focus as reflected by the ratio of singular to plural pronouns such as &quot;I&quot;/&quot;we.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a look at the original article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/51/e2107848118.full&quot;&gt;The rise and fall of rationality in language&lt;/a&gt;, by Marten Scheffer, Ingrid van de Leemput, Els Weinans, and Johan Bollen. Unfortunately, the article was not written in English, but in a closely related language called Statistics. I know a few words of Statistics, so I managed to decipher the article and get the gist of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors studied the language in millions of books published between 1850 and 2019, using Google nGram data. As the first link above notes, they found first an increase then a decrease in rationality words such as determine and conclusion. They found this pattern in both fiction and nonfiction. As a control, they analyzed words in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and found similar trends. They also performed similar analyses in Spanish to ensure that the findings were not an artifact of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also identified two opposite “poles”: the personal and the societal. The personal pole prefers words that they classify as related to belief or intuition, the body, or various activities. The societal poll prefers words related to science and technology. The authors tentatively relate the personal pole to what they call intuitive thinking, and the societal poll to rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this fall of rationality is not just the result of scientists’ taking my advice and writing in the first person singular when appropriate; it seems to be happening throughout books and periodicals. As the authors note in their abstract,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;… this reversal occurs in fiction as well as nonfiction. Moreover, the pattern of change in the ratio between sentiment and rationality flag words since 1850 also occurs in New York Times articles, suggesting that it is not an artifact of the book corpora we analyzed. Finally, we show that word trends in books parallel trends in corresponding Google search terms, supporting the idea that changes in book language do in part reflect changes in interest. All in all, our results suggest that over the past decades, there has been a marked shift in public interest from the collective to the individual, and from rationality toward emotion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted several people, and one of those contacted yet another. One of my correspondents was skeptical of doing a principal components analysis on z-scores; that is Greek – I mean &lt;i&gt;Statistics&lt;/i&gt; to me. He suggests also that electronic publishing has enabled many, many books that (shall we say) would not have made it as far as an acquisitions editor; he suggests looking at library classification codes, which he thinks are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;obviously a much more reliable indicator of semantic content than are the frequencies of certain words designated as semantic markers of “individuality,” “rationality,” etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;, I agree that it has largely pivoted toward feature articles, and doing so may have simplified its terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person who was contacted by my correspondent pointed to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[l]ess passive construction, more agency in the nouns—both of which tend to shorten the length of sentences, making them easier for readers to read, but also taking up less paper for folks who print these papers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some time after 1980, certainly by 2000, self-published books and self-help books may have altered or distorted the vocabulary. Indeed, as one of my correspondents has noted, in 1850,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;educated&quot; people learned Latin and Greek, and a lot of their writing reflected the grammatical and syntactical influences of those languages (Latin more than Greek). … As we dropped the pretense, scientific communication became more crisp and colloquial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue was that these highly &quot;educated&quot; individuals were almost all of social classes that did not &quot;work&quot; for their money. This was a group of privileged individuals, and one way of marking that privilege was with language: … the writing resembles English, but it has a frame of reference that is all its own, and those standing outside the frame often cannot penetrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Thus,] there is a trend to break down the rhetorical structures that exclude broad swaths of people who might make up a more diverse audience (and market). There certainly is a profit motive, but there is also (potentially) a communitarian motive: people do better if they have easier access to accurate information, so changes in rhetorical structure might be a way to accomplish this [that is, easier access to information] (albeit with downsides as the current COVID outbreak shows us).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know whether this last analysis explains why the turning point is around 1980, but I will let it be the last word.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Examples of trends in the use of words related to rationality (top panel) vs. intuition (bottom panel) (This figure may be used free of rights in press coverage) A correspondent the other day sent us a link to an article with this intriguing title, ‘We conclude’ or ‘I believe?’ Study finds rationality declined decades ago.

I find it surprising and sad how quickly the amazing life and accomplishments of Ernst Mayr have faded from the memories of a new generation of biologists. I think Mayr had a bigger and more progressive influence on the development of evolutionary biology in the 20th Century, and the betterment of the world as a whole, than probably any other biologist. 
Mayr emphasized the importance of understanding the natural history of organisms to understand their evolution. He was way ahead of his time in arguing that our emphasis should be on studying whole genomes, rather than individual genes. He spent a lifetime encouraging young people to study biology and the natural world. After immigrating to the US from the horrors of Nazi Germany in the early 1930s, he spoke out against racism and segregation at a time when many of his fellow biologists were doing the opposite. He published over 700 influential articles and 24 books on biological practice and theory, 200 of which he published after he &quot;retired.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mayr worked to establish several major evolutionary societies, including the Society for the Study of Evolution and the Society of Systematic Zoologists (now Society of Systematic Biologists). He not only spent his time and efforts to found and support these societies, he also supported them financially. For example, in the 1970s he endowed a student award within SSZ to encourage young systematists to enter the field (now named the Ernst Mayr Award). That award has long been used to encourage young systematic biologists of diverse backgrounds to become engaged in studying biodiversity. He left an additional large gift to SSB in his will, which became the nucleus of SSB's endowment that has enabled the many programs and funding opportunities that society now provides to encourage young systematists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I greatly admire the life and accomplishments of Mayr, even though he and I frequently disagreed over scientific issues. He was already one of the 20th Century's most famous biologists when I met him, and I was just a lowly graduate student working on bringing molecular techniques into systematics. Mayr was not a big fan of this; he was not anti-molecular systematics, but he argued (quite reasonably) that single gene analyses of systematic questions were problematic, and he thought that many molecular systematists did not pay enough attention to the biology and natural history of their organisms (which was often true). After I co-edited the book Molecular Systematics in 1990, he and I often discussed the development and expansion of molecular techniques in the field. But despite our disagreements over this (as well as various issues of systematic theory), he was always cordial, encouraging, warm, and most of all—knowledgeable. It was always clear to me that he read the literature exhaustively. When he asked me questions about or critiqued my papers, it was clear that he had read and thought about them carefully. He had a command of the literature like no one else that I'd ever encountered, or have encountered since. He taught me that people can disagree about issues, and still be great friends (in fact, it can even help and build a friendship to discuss such disagreements).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people today likely picture Mayr as an old man, as he was over 100 when he died in 2005, and most living people would remember him (if at all) as an old man. This photo of him (on the right in the photo) shows him as a 23-year-old field biologist in New Guinea in 1928. He had an enormous, positive influence on the world, and especially on the positive development of evolutionary and systematic biology. We should remember and thank him for that. He worked to make the world, and his discipline, better than they were when he came into them. I think that is the lofty goal that we should all strive to achieve in our lives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I am deeply saddened to see in today's e-mail a proposal to eliminate Ernst Mayr's name from the Society of Systematic Biology's Ernst Mayr Award. As this post from last year describes, Mayr was champion of inclusion and diversity; he worked to fight discrimination in science; he supported young scientists, and endowed the student award that bares his name. Members of the society will get to vote on this constitutional change, and I hope that they have the wisdom to continue honoring his life and contributions with this named award.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposal to change the name claims that some members disagree with some of his writings, even though Mayr &quot;was a prolific and profound scholar of evolutionary biology and a dedicated champion of students.&quot; Really? We are now eliminating mention of people because someone disagrees with some of their academic ideas? That is especially troublesome in this case, as Mayr was an ardent defender of equality and inclusion, and spoke out effectively against racial discrimination (as discussed below).
Please, if you are a member of SSB, vote against this mean-spirited and unfair discrimination against Mayr on the spring 2022 ballot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…and then…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(210, 210, 210); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Hillis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Even given all of Mayr's vast biological accomplishments, I think what most impresses me about him were his efforts to build a better world for all. For example, in 1951, in support of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000073351&quot;&gt;UNESCO 1951: The race concept: Results of an inquiry&lt;/a&gt;,” Mayr made a public statement opposing the views of R. A. Fisher, and supporting the UNESCO statement:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mayr stated that he hoped that “the authoritative Statement prepared by UNESCO will help to eliminate the pseudo-scientific race conceptions which have been used as excuses for many injustices and even shocking crimes”… “I applaud and wholeheartedly endorse [it],” Mayr wrote, adding: “It cannot be emphasized too strongly that all so-called races are variable populations, and that there is often more difference between extreme individuals of one race than between certain individuals of different races. All human races are mixtures of populations and the term “pure race” is an absurdity. The second important point which needs stressing is that genetics plays a very minor part in the cultural characteristics of different peoples. . . . The third point is that equality of opportunity and equality in law do not depend on physical, intellectual and genetic identity. There are striking differences in physical, intellectual and other genetically founded qualities among individuals of even the most homogeneous human population, even among brothers and sisters. No acknowledged ethical principle exists which would permit denial of equal opportunity for reason of such differences to any member of the human species.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three years later, US Supreme Court cited this same Mayr-supported UNESCO statement in the landmark desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Mayr spoke up and did the right thing at a critical time, when many of his colleagues were doing the opposite.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.systbio.org/award-naming.html&quot;&gt;SSB announcement about de-naming the Ernst Mayr Award&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(227, 180, 180); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;SSB Council Review of the Mayr Award and Award Names&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the summer of 2020, the SSB Council began a discussion about potentially renaming the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology at the request of society members. Since then, the SSB leadership have been working in conjunction with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to learn more about the origin of named awards and their representation of the diverse membership within the society. Renaming the award is one step toward greater inclusivity within the society, as named awards often lead to feelings of exclusion among those who are members of underrepresented groups whose scientific contributions continue to remain unrecognized. At a council meeting following Virtual Evolution 2021, the Council voted to propose to all members an award name change, in conjunction with other actions intended to better recognize SSB’s history and legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The SSB Council proposes to rename the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology to the Outstanding Student Presentation Award in Systematic Biology. Our scientific community is more diverse than the cohort of early scientists with recognized contributions to systematics and science generally. Many current members do not see themselves reflected in awards that bear the names of these early scientists and can feel excluded as potential recipients as a result. In a field whose composition still does not reflect global human diversity, having an award named after a particular individual reinforces that members with other identities are outsiders. By proposing this name change, we hope to address this specific barrier to making our society more inclusive and welcoming. We, the SSB council, are made up of a diverse group of people who don’t all view Mayr in the same light. This proposal is not intended to cast judgement on the legacy of Ernst Mayr, who was a prolific and profound scholar of evolutionary biology and a dedicated champion of students, nor are we intending to defend the contents of his writings which some find problematic. We are grateful for Mayr’s generous gifts to our society, which created the endowment that allows us to support student research today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Council sees preservation of the society’s history and increasing diversity, equity and inclusion as synergistic endeavors toward the improvement of our community. The proposed change continues our history of becoming more inclusive over time: for example, in the 1990s we changed from the Society for Systematic Zoology to the Society of Systematic Biologists (and changed the journal name as well) to welcome members of our community who do not study animals. Thus, SSB President Laura Kubatko has acted on the recommendation of the DEI Committee to form a new committee, the SSB Legacy Committee, that will be tasked with creating accessible content about our society's history (e.g., as a section on our website). The formation of this committee is intended as a way to acknowledge the contributions of past members to the existence of the society and to the field broadly. In this way, the legacy of the society may be understood by our membership more comprehensively than is possible through named awards, and we have the opportunity to celebrate the many people of various backgrounds who have made systematic biology what it is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Because the award is named in our Constitution, the name can only be changed by a formal amendment to the Constitution. Following the procedure outlined in our Constitution, the SSB Council thus voted in August 2021 to propose an Amendment to the Constitution to be submitted to the SSB Membership for a vote. The Constitution specifies that the proposed Amendment will pass if at least 2/3 of the members vote in favor. This issue will be presented to the membership on the Spring 2022 ballot. The proposed amendment is shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My attempts to put some context onto Twitter in the midst of the Great R.A. Fisher Panic of June 2020 – almost wholly unsuccessfully, I might add – are here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1: https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1270280876958474240 &lt;br /&gt;
Part 2: https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1270287477928939521&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, some of the back-and-forth over Fisher in June 2020 was the origin of the SSB Mayr Award controversy, i.e. these posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/Lagomarsino_L/status/1270856892630339601 &lt;br /&gt;
https://twitter.com/landismj/status/1270756154940022784&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version of my argument in June 2020 was that we shouldn’t make hasty judgments about R.A. Fisher, because if you have read much about the history of eugenics or scientific racism, and the history of the opposition to the same, you realise that many of the people who made substantial progress in defeating these repugnant views did not achieve perfection instantaneously.  Views on race and eugenics changed gradually, step-by-step, with some mistakes and prejudices (e.g. polygenism) defeated long before others (e.g. the idea that biological race referred to real, meaningful categories). The people who fought against Nazi eugenics before World War 2 were largely eugenicists themselves (but “reform eugenicists”).  There were anti-racist eugenicists, anti-eugenics racists, etc.  None of this should be surprising to evolutionary biologists, of all people, who generally have an instinct for the importance and complexity of history, and how gradual change in many small steps can add up to big changes where the end result is almost unrecognizable from the beginning point.  The interesting thing about progress in moral views is not when it is done by people who are morally perfect. The interesting thing is when this progress is made by imperfect people, despite received wisdom and their initial prejudices. The process is, I think, not unlike scientific discovery. And in the case of racism &amp;amp; eugenics, scientific discoveries and moral progress were often linked, and many of the people who did the linking were the very evolutionary greats who are now being canned right and left.  For all of these reasons and more, it is more important to acknowledge the important progress people made, rather than the inherited assumptions they failed to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this, and more, would have to be taken into consideration in a fair evaluation of R.A. Fisher.  Using the old creationist tactic of quote-mining and putting up something that looks bad on Twitter is not a reliable method for judgment of historical matters. So, in the midst of discussing these issues in a heated Twitter discussion, I said, consider Ernst Mayr: if you google his name plus the word “eugenics”, which anyone can do very easily, you find something. You can play this trick for almost any biologist and/or progressive active between about 1900 and 1970. I never imagined people would take this seriously enough in the case of Ernst Mayr to begin discussing de-naming his award.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Now, I have to acknowledge that I have been told by Josef Uyeda that (1) those Twitter replies may have kicked off the SSB Board’s discussion of the Mayr Award, but (2) no one made a serious case against Ernst Mayr that he heard about, and the denaming proposal and vote is really, truly, not about Mayr’s views or reputation, but about the abstract issue of whether or not awards should be named after individuals at all.  (I guess everything from the Nobel Prize on down should be denamed according to this logic.) I am happy to acknowledge his representation of his views. However, I think that the SSB proposal text itself, and the overall context of canning famous evolutionists left and right without anything resembling historical due diligence, indicates that much more is involved. We are living through an age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm&quot;&gt;iconoclasm&lt;/a&gt;, and legitimate rage against Trumpism, massive economic inequality, Covid denialism, and the rest, is being redirected to all kinds of weird places due to the difficulty of fixing the core problems.  It is all made worse by everyone being even more online than usual due to the pandemic, physical libraries and old paper books and sources being less accessible than usual, and the lack of face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read Uyeda’s views in his own words at his Twitter thread, here: https://twitter.com/pseudacris/status/1479177881360207874&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you are in SSB, please vote against this proposal. Spasms of iconoclasm have to burn out somewhere, and it would be a further honor to Ernst Mayr if his award was the firebreak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nick Matzke</name></author><summary type="html">David Hillis posted the following short essay to Facebook on June 21, 2021.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Old arguments never die, they just get recycled.  From Wikimedia.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the end of 2021, which has been a fairly miserable year for most of us.  So it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what is the most ridiculous argument put forward this year for ID or for creationism.  I’m going to give my own choice, which is both highly technical and highly absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you get to make a nomination of your own. (There will no winner chosen or prize awarded).  The argument need not be one that was first proposed in 2021, as long as it continued to be put forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own choice is the Algorithmic Specified Complexity argument, which purports to show mathematically that
high levels of adaptation cannot be achieved, because the length of the “program” used is unusually short, and
this is backed up by very impressive, and sometimes quite correct, mathematical proofs.  The effort is usually
to show that the length of the program needed is conserved, so perhaps it cannot be changed by evolution.  Perhaps.    I’ve ranted and
raved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;another
post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
about the wrongness of this two years ago here.  But the argument has never been disowned by any of its
advocates, including Robert Marks, Winston Ewert, or Eric Holloway.  So it is still out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it is silly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There never is any attempt by its advocates to show that an unusually simple program is needed for a highly fit
adaptation, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is never clarified whether the “program” computes the genotype, the phenotype, or something else, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the name is ludicrous: “Complexity” is achieved by the program being unusually simple (the reverse of
the way algorithmic complexity theory is used to discuss random numbers),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The distribution of binary bitstrings used is totally arbitrary, and there could be many others as well- (or ill-)
justified.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When one asks about how any of this works, the authors of the theory simply say that they are not biologists,
so they leave the filling in of those details to the biologists, but&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somehow they still expect people to consider their argument to be meaningful biologically.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument has such a tension between its mathematical pretentiousness and its basic meaninglessness that
for me it achieves worstness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, that’s my candidate for Worst.  What’s yours?  We have quite a few wise heads here who are quite familiar with the
arguments ID advocates and creationists make.  If you aren’t as familiar, just take a look at the Discovery Institute’s “Evolution
News and Science Today” site and start reading stories there.  It will supply
you with lots of candidates.

It is the end of 2021, which has been a fairly miserable year for most of us. So it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what is the most ridiculous argument put forward this year for ID or for creationism. I’m going to give my own choice, which is both highly technical and highly absurd. But you get to make a nomination of your own. (There will no winner chosen or prize awarded). The argument need not be one that was first proposed in 2021, as long as it continued to be put forward. My own choice is the Algorithmic Specified Complexity argument, which purports to show mathematically that high levels of adaptation cannot be achieved, because the length of the “program” used is unusually short, and this is backed up by very impressive, and sometimes quite correct, mathematical proofs. The effort is usually to show that the length of the program needed is conserved, so perhaps it cannot be changed by evolution. Perhaps. I’ve ranted and raved in another post about the wrongness of this two years ago here. But the argument has never been disowned by any of its advocates, including Robert Marks, Winston Ewert, or Eric Holloway. So it is still out there. Here’s why it is silly: There never is any attempt by its advocates to show that an unusually simple program is needed for a highly fit adaptation, and It is never clarified whether the “program” computes the genotype, the phenotype, or something else, and Even the name is ludicrous: “Complexity” is achieved by the program being unusually simple (the reverse of the way algorithmic complexity theory is used to discuss random numbers), The distribution of binary bitstrings used is totally arbitrary, and there could be many others as well- (or ill-) justified.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/Ham_Job_Foundation_Earth_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ham tweet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent sent us this tweet by Ken Ham:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; There's only one way to go back in time &amp;amp; that's to read the true history of the universe God revealed to us in His Word beginning in Genesis. &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&quot; (Job 38:4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Mr. Ham’s take on the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. I find it astonishing, even for something coming from Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it gives quoting out of context a very bad name. The story of Job is a horrible one (I have written a bit more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, pp. 160-168). In the book, God gives Satan permission to torture Job and kill his family, for no other reason than to win a bet with Satan. Job, in contrast to God, seems to believe in justice or fairness, and calls out to God to show him his guilt. God’s response is to mock Job. Chapter 38, the chapter cited by Mr. Ham, reads (according to the 1985 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sefaria.org/Job.38.4?lang=bi&quot;&gt;JPS Tanakh&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak if you have understanding. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Onto what were its bases sunk? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who set its cornerstone …? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God to goes on to browbeat and belittle Job. Though God never addresses Job’s concern, Job finally gives in, admitting that he is “but dust and ashes.” How such a reprehensible story buttresses the case for creation escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, and perhaps worse, a careful reading of the text shows clearly that its author thought of the earth as a solid object with a physical foundation and a base that was sunk into something (perhaps like a pile driven into the earth?). Unsurprisingly, then, we find that Mr. Ham is quoting as an authority an author who thinks that the earth is a flat slab, possibly sitting on some unknown foundation into which piles have been driven, and probably with a dome over it. (Possibly that foundation is sitting on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;.) Hardly a portion of the Bible that I would want to quote if I wanted to cite an authority on the creation of the earth. But with Mr. Ham, we never know. Any out-of-context quotation will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">A correspondent sent us this tweet by Ken Ham: There's only one way to go back in time &amp;amp; that's to read the true history of the universe God revealed to us in His Word beginning in Genesis. &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&quot; (Job 38:4) It is Mr. Ham’s take on the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.
