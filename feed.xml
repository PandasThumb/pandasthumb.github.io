In particular, Mr. Phelps read an October 27 tweet (or a twX or whatever they are called now) in which Mr. Ham proclaimed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At @AiG we have stated so many times before that the Ark was funded 100% by private funding. Let me say it again, the @ArkEncounter project and the @CreationMuseum were both funded 100% from private funding. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps notes that the Ark receives a sales tax rebate of $1.825 million every year. Perhaps, he says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Ham could always decide not to cash the check and return it to the Commonwealth of Kentucky if he wishes to keep claiming lack of government support. However, even if he returned the sales tax rebate money, he would still be getting or has received all sorts of other money and benefits from state, county, and city sources. These include and have included: &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;City of Williamstown sold Ark 98 acres of land for $1. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City also gave AIG $175,000 in cash. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City reduced property tax on Ark. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City issued $62 million in unsecured junk bonds for Ark construction. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;75% of Ark Encounter's property taxes will go to repaying bonds instead of to local government. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Employees of Ark Encounter must pay 2% of wages to Ark bond debt (for next 30 years). &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;State transportation cabinet spent $11 million to upgrade Interstate 75 exits in anticipation of huge traffic increase that did not occur. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;AIG claims Ark is worth $130 million on 990 forms to Federal government and potentially when getting loans. Grant County property tax valuation (which supports local schools) assesses Ark value at $48 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire tweet (or whatever) is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, a headline in an unspecified newspaper proclaimed that Representative Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House of the moment, had once funded a Noah’s Ark theme park. Mr. Ham categorizes this claim as a lie. Whether or not it is a lie or merely an error, Mr. Phelps notes that on this point only, Mr. Ham is correct. Interestingly, though, Mr. Johnson once successfully represented the Ark in a suit against the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article44504949.html&quot;&gt;this diatribe&lt;/a&gt; against Mr. Phelps under the head, “Ark Park unfairly damned.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Our indefatigable colleague Dan Phelps seems to have caught Ken Ham in a, um, mild prevarication and corrects the record here.

The occasion was the publication of Robert Sapolsky’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Determined-Science-Life-without-Free-ebook/dp/B0BSKQ5ZDM/&quot;&gt;Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will&lt;/a&gt;. Sapolsky, in turn, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/science/free-will-sapolsky.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Hope Reese in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. The online title, incidentally, was “Robert Sapolsky doesn’t believe in free will. (But feel free to disagree.)”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne, Sapolsky, and I are what are called “hard determinists”: we think that “all our actions are determined by the laws of physics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know what all the fuss is about; any physicist could have told them that. Indeed, I said it myself in a 2001 book on science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was &lt;i&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe&lt;/i&gt;. It suffered from two main problems: (1) It was 5 or 10 years ahead of its time, and (2) it was not shrill enough and too sympathetic to religion. I have long ago given up the idea of becoming rich on it, and you may read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the point: In that book, I argued that humans were biological creatures and therefore governed by the laws of physics. Those laws are deterministic (we will get back to that in a minute), so everything we do, think, or decide is determined by those laws. We may think we have free will; we certainly have to act as if we have free will; but in fact we have no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before you get your knickers in a twist, none of the foregoing implies, for example, that we should not punish criminals. The pain they may inflict is real, and we may have to separate them from society until (or unless) they reform. I suggest, however, that their lack of free will suggests that we should be rehabilitating rather than punishing criminals. But that discussion is a little off-task here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wrote &lt;i&gt;NSO&lt;/i&gt;, I assumed that quantum mechanics was itself purely deterministic and that some day we would discover an underlying, deterministic theory. It simply seemed unreasonable that, for example, an atomic nucleus would decide all on its own to emit an alpha particle, rather than being caused to do so by some external agency. It still seems unreasonable to me, but it may not be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does quantum mechanics then come to our rescue and somehow grant free will? No. First, so many molecules are involved in, say, neurotransmission that their action may be considered completely classical and therefore completely deterministic. Even so, the occasional quantum fluctuation would not so much grant free will as it would make our decisions somewhat random, a condition that I think proponents of free will would not particularly care for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum randomness may have been critically important to the evolution of the early universe. If we ran the “experiment” again, we might, for all I know, end up with a very different universe, one that does not even include us. That said, quantum randomness has very little effect on our daily lives, unless you count, for example, cancers induced by radioactive decay or cosmic radiation. Thus, as Sapolsky would argue, everything we think, say, and do is wholly and unequivocally determined by our detailed histories (except, as I have noted, for the occasional quantum fluctuation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conclude, then, that we have no free will in any sense. I do not understand why some people consider that threatening; it simply is the way it is. We feel as if we have free will, we act as if we have free will, and we are treated as if we have free will. Free will is thus a useful fiction, but in reality it is only a fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will undoubtedly read Sapolsky’s book when I get a chance. I think, though, that I will end with a complaint, one that I have made before: The Kindle edition of this book, which I may lease but not own, costs $18.99. The hardcover costs $23.28, and the paperback $12.95. Thus, I am expected to spend $6.04 for the convenience of leasing the Kindle edition, rather than owning the paperback edition. I was not going to write this paragraph, but I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Jerry Coyne ran an article the other day on the question of free will.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/Hotez_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Hotez and his team have developed inexpensive vaccines and distributed them to the Third World through a nonprofit organization. No good deed goes unpunished, and as he describes in the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Rise-Anti-science-Scientists-Warning-ebook/dp/B0BWSLNSVY&quot;&gt;The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science&lt;/a&gt;, he was therefore vilified by the anti-vaccination faction. Anti-vaxxers, as they are often called, have gained so much influence that so far 200,000 Americans have died of Covid because they refused the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaxxers have had enough influence that we now see occasional outbreaks of measles, a disease that once had been virtually eliminated. I remember the polio epidemic of the 1940’s and -50’s, and I am very much afraid that mandatory vaccinations for students in public schools may be on the way out. Indeed, Dr. Hotez notes that preliminary data show declines in childhood immunization in conservative states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hotez sees the anti-vaxxers as part of a right-wing conspiracy to undermine not just vaccination but science in general. You may consider it overstatement, but he compares the anti-vaccination, anti-science movement to similar movements in Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. He is sufficiently concerned that he suggests courses in science communication for graduate students. Additionally, he suggests something like a Southern Poverty Law Center to protect scientists and academics, but the proposal is too vague to merit much discussion here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the problem has become political, not scientific. Virtually no reputable scientists doubt the value of vaccines (nor accept the efficacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scdhec.gov/covid19/dangers-using-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-preventing-or-treating-covid-19&quot;&gt;hydrochloroquine or ivermectin&lt;/a&gt;). Nevertheless, a significant amount of money from right-wing sources is spreading disinformation about vaccination, just as they have about climate change and evolution. Russia has also apparently developed a program of vaccine disinformation aimed at the United States. Vaccine denialism is also spreading worldwide. Dr. Hotez claims that far-right and extremist groups “play hardball.” I think he is mistaken: they play snowball with rocks concealed inside their snowballs. No one, he says, is coming to our rescue; we have to take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, Dr. Hotez went public and appeared in television interviews, including on Fox News, in an attempt, as he put it, to reach across the aisle. When he was subsequently attacked by the right wing, most ominously white supremacists and anti-Semites, he checked in with the climate-change expert Michael Mann and found that the attack by climate-change deniers paralleled the attack by anti-vaxxers. Climate scientists now have a system for responding to the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-science faction is already sufficiently in control in, say, Florida that the governor there gets his advice from “contrarians and so-called experts from far-right think tanks.” In this vein, you may read a nice section on Trofim Lysenko and the influence he had in the Soviet Union under Stalin. The brain drain from Nazi Germany may also be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book makes a case for vaccination and also notes that the number and distribution of those who succumbed to the Covid virus (and therefore did not vote) could have been enough to tip the last presidential election in favor of Pres. Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, Dr. Hotez says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[he] came to believe the tremendous loss in human life from the COVID-19 immunization refusal was not an accident but an orchestrated product of a networked political ecosystem of anti-science extremism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he notes, you cannot defeat this kind of anti-science extremism with facts and data; emotional appeals can be far more compelling (see also my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/06/how-to-talk-science-denier.html&quot;&gt;How to Talk to a Science Denier&lt;/a&gt;, by Lee McIntyre). The government, for its part, hoped the extremists would run out of gas and “die a quiet death.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hotez is a professor of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and has an appointment at the Texas Children’s Hospital. He was introduced to the anti-science world when he published a book, &lt;i&gt;Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s [his daughter’s] Autism&lt;/i&gt;, and was attacked by the anti-vaxx crowd, which believes otherwise, partly as a result of a thoroughly discredited study. He worked hard to develop the Covid vaccine and supply it to the Third World. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, as he reminds us more than once, but I had the impression that it was his own colleagues who nominated him. The book, while good and useful, sometimes has a little more personal narrative than I might have wanted and appears just a wee bit self-serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Histogram of reviews on Amazon as of October 18, 2023.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, the book gets a sizeable number of one-star reviews on Amazon (see the figure). Some of the reviewers have read the book; some have not. I imagine it is a quasi-orchestrated attempt to denigrate the work, as happened previously with respect to the film, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Believe_in_Dinosaurs&quot;&gt;We Believe in Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told myself I would not exactly review the book, but I cannot help noticing mistakes like these: pedal for peddle, diffuse for defuse. Additionally, I was somewhat put off by the use of first names – Tony instead of Fauci or Dr. Fauci – which had the effect, probably unintentional, of showing how the author is on first-name terms with several VIP’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[open rant]And finally, I am the author or co-author of 5 published books, so I am the last person who would begrudge a publisher or an author their due. Yet I was very put off when I found that the Kindle edition cost $21.34, whereas the hardback (there is no paperback) cost &lt;strike&gt;$24.95&lt;/strike&gt; $22.46, or $1.12 more than the Kindle – and I do not even get to own the Kindle edition! Surely, the marginal cost of manufacturing the hardback book is well over $1.12. So I confess that, in a fit of pique, I borrowed the Kindle edition from a library. It seems to me that a Kindle book, which I technically lease but do not purchase, has virtually no marginal cost and ought to cost less than a paperback, yet their prices are slowly inching up.[end rant]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Peter Hotez and his team have developed inexpensive vaccines and distributed them to the Third World through a nonprofit organization.

&lt;p&gt;All this relates to the Fisher-window &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/23/a-cambridge-college-reflects-on-the-controversy-over-ronald-fisher&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; you may recall from summer 2020. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; kindly agreed to host the interview via their youtube page. As of this writing, they even show this interview as a &quot;featured link&quot; from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/discover/fisher-21st-century&quot;&gt;2022 symposium page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview was produced by me &amp;amp; Axel Zeitler largely because we felt that Anthony (arguably the most qualified living person to say anything about Fisher's legacy) had been marginalized during the 2020 process. Until now, his voice was notably absent from from the 2022 symposium as well. Anyway, we're pleased that the college agreed (in Aug 2023) to add this interview to the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What follows is a summary of a longer article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ag-evolutionsbiologie.net/pdf/2023/evolution-why-birds-are-living-dinosaurs.pdf&quot;&gt;Why do we know that birds are living dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt; published (in English) by AG Evolutionsbiologie, a German scientific association that deals with evolutionary biology and creationism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding that birds are descendants of certain dinosaurs has been a scientific consensus for over 20 years. Only a very few experts still question it. In the publications of those who deny macroevolution and want to have it replaced by an “intelligent” origin (that is, creationists of various stripes), such criticism is clearly overrepresented. However, unlike the scientists they cite, creationists do not primarily cast doubt on the membership of birds in particular archosaur taxa. Rather, they want to see the evolutionary development as such questioned. They achieve this only by mixing the criticism of individual scientists with antiquated and factually incorrect ideas on evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the creationists who is concerned with criticizing avian evolution is Reinhard Junker, former managing director of the German evangelical association Wort-und-Wissen. His argumentation is typical of creationist criticism. Since such criticism relies on antiquated views of evolution, numerous findings look like serious anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this review, we explain why birds' ancestry from Mesozoic dinosaurs is a scientifically well-established fact. Afterwards, we discuss popular objections against this thesis presented by creationists like Reinhard Junker and by scientists like Alan Feduccia as well. We show that creationist criticism is working under a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of evolutionary theory. This line of reasoning is influential worldwide. It is representative of the whole creationist spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ten main theses of our analysis are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The statement &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; birds are the product of a long, evolutionary-historical process is logically independent of the question of &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; this evolution proceeded in detail. The evolution of birds and birds' ancestry from Mesozoic dinosaurs is essentially supported by the fact that we can put theropod fossils into a sequence in which their shape gradually takes on the appearance of modern birds. Given that descent, heritable variability, and speciation are &lt;i&gt;observed facts&lt;/i&gt;, bird evolution (or evolution in general) would remain untouched even if we knew nothing about its mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creationists allege a &lt;i&gt;waiting time problem&lt;/i&gt; causing a very slow pace of evolution. Hence, in their eyes, evolutionary mechanisms are overstrained by producing the great diversity of avian forms “abruptly” in geologically short periods. However, their reasoning is quite wrong. First, creationists do not seem to have understood how novelties arise in evolution. For instance, evolution never faced the task of waiting until a “fixed and pre-specified target” was reached. Second, the evolvability of novelties, even of &lt;i&gt;irreducibly complex systems&lt;/i&gt;, within short time periods is a well-corroborated and no longer reasonably disputable fact (see, for instance, HUNT 2007b; TONKIN et al. 2008; DE KRAKER &amp;amp; GERSHENZON 2011; SAUTER et al. 2012; TROTTER et al. 2014; YONA et al. 2018; RAWCLIFFE 2019; BEYER et al. 2022; NEUKAMM 2022).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to the &lt;i&gt;“abrupt” appearance of characters&lt;/i&gt; in the fossil record, the explanation of &lt;i&gt;punctuated equilibria&lt;/i&gt; must be considered as well as the ambiguity of the term “abrupt”. When a paleontologist speaks of the “abrupt” appearance of a feature, he may still think of periods of millions of years. Here, the biased and fragmentary sedimentary record, both in time and in space, must be taken into account. Abrupt appearance may hence be a &lt;i&gt;geological artifact&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creationists ignore the progress of &lt;i&gt;evolutionary developmental biology&lt;/i&gt; (Evo-Devo) in solving specific problems. This includes, for example, the question of how the supposedly contradictory counting of fingers in some theropods (apparently, I-II-III) and birds (II-III-IV) fits together. Evo-Devo can also explain the capability for comparatively rapid convergent evolution of quite a few avian features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution deniers portray the &lt;i&gt;convergence problem&lt;/i&gt; as much more serious than it is. Despite widespread convergence and uncertainty about the position of some taxa, there is a remarkable consensus on the backbone structure of the family tree of the ancestors of birds and the relative hierarchical placement of almost all major clades that constitute this tree. Birds still lie in a deeply nested position within Theropoda (RAUHUT &amp;amp; FOTH 2020, p. 37).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrary to creationists' reasoning, &lt;i&gt;widespread convergences are not anomalies&lt;/i&gt; but rather a clear expectation of evolutionary theory when &lt;i&gt;developmental biological background knowledge is considered&lt;/i&gt; (MCGHEE 2011, p. 7).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For at least half a century, the idea that evolution must run &lt;i&gt;continuously and linearly&lt;/i&gt; has not been compatible with contemporary knowledge of the processes of speciation and differentiation of species (MAHNER 1986, p. 68). Creationists do not seem to know that just these processes are accompanied by discontinuities, incongruities, and a zigzag course (such as reversions of traits in different lineages).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creationists place antiquated expectations on the nature of evolutionary &lt;i&gt;transitional forms&lt;/i&gt; and claim to have recognized “contradictory” trait mosaics. Hence, they ignore that mosaic evolution is the result of genetic burdens (RIEDL 2003, p. 209) and lineage-splitting events (MAYR 1967, p. 465 f.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The claim that the features of the avian body plan could not have evolved isolated from each other is false. The theropod fossils can be placed in a sequence in which the “irreducibly complex overall organization” of birds resolves into a &lt;i&gt;series of consecutive feature addition steps&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creationists seem not to understand &lt;i&gt;cladogenesis&lt;/i&gt;; otherwise, they would not problematize the &lt;i&gt;phylogenetic-stratigraphic discrepancy&lt;/i&gt;, i.e., the &lt;i&gt;chronologically later appearance of some species with more primitive features &lt;/i&gt; in the fossil record. (For the attempt to compress the geological time scale by six orders of magnitude, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ag-evolutionsbiologie.net/html/2014/kreationismus-und-radiometrische-datierung.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
