  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Red Panda, &lt;em&gt;Ailurus fulgens&lt;/em&gt;, wondering what part of the tree it's on.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-tale-of-two-papers&quot;&gt;A tale of two papers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, dr Matthew / Matyas Cserhati published two parallel articles on the affinities of the red panda &lt;em&gt;Ailurus fulgens&lt;/em&gt;, one in BMC Genomics and one in Creation Research Society Quarterly. The two articles are mostly based on the same data and have similar and sometimes identical content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07531-3&quot;&gt;The BMC Genomics article&lt;/a&gt; has the title: “A tail of two pandas – whole genome k-mer signature analysis of the red panda (&lt;em&gt;Ailurus fulgens&lt;/em&gt;) and the Giant panda (&lt;em&gt;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&lt;/em&gt;)”. This paper concludes that on a whole genome level the red panda possibly belongs to the mustelid (marten) clade. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creationresearch.org/classification-of-the-enigmatic-red-panda-ailurus-fulgens-based-on-molecular-baraminology-based-analysis&quot;&gt;The CRSQ article&lt;/a&gt; has the title: “Classification of the enigmatic red panda (&lt;em&gt;Ailurus fulgens&lt;/em&gt;) based on molecular baraminology-based analysis”. This paper deems it likely that the red panda belongs to the mustelid holobaramin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bmc-genomics-paper&quot;&gt;The BMC Genomics paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cserhati uses two types of data for the phylogenetic placement of the red panda: Whole Genome K-mer Signature (WGKS) and sequence analysis on mtDNA.  Cserhati establishes the frequency spectrum of all possible 8-mer base sequences over the whole genome of a species for 28 species. For each species pair a correlation coefficient over 8-mer frequencies can be computed, leading to a correlation matrix of genomic patterning over the species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cserhati uses the correlation matrix to find 4 clusters: the eleven cats, the five bears, the skunk, and a cluster containing the martens and the red panda. But then Cserhati writes: “Based on this evidence, (the red panda) would belong to (the marten family) as a monophyletic group.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the article derails. &lt;!--more--&gt; The clustering can be regarded as evidence that the red panda and the marten family are monophyletic sister groups, but not that the red panda belongs to the marten family. The red panda has a lower mean correlation with the marten species than the mean correlation of the marten species amongst each other, showing a clear distance between panda and martens. This difference is significant (P &amp;lt; 1.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;) but Cserhati writes “This difference is not too significant”, and he decides to ignore it. In his heat map of the correlation matrix the difference between red panda and marten species is clearly visible: left figure on top, lighter is higher correlation, and the red panda gives the top right ‘Finnish flag’ pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mtDNA sequences of 52 species/subspecies of bears, skunks, raccoons, martens, and both subspecies of the red panda are aligned and clustered. Cserhati finds 5 clusters: the 15 bears, the 30 martens, the two panda sequences, the two skunks and the 3 raccoons, clearly finding the traditional families. The mtDNA sequences are subjected to phylogenetic analysis by UPGMA, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbour Joining. No outgroup is mentioned, and no outgroup seems to have been specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three phylogenetic trees on mtDNA differ in the placement of the families. The mess seems the result of the lack of outgroup. When plotting an unrooted tree in a square format, the program picks the plot. The pandas do not appear within the marten family in any of the three phylogenetic trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cserhati gives his preferred conclusion: “The main conclusion … is that on a whole genome level (the red panda) possibly belongs to the (marten) clade”. Nowhere in his analyses does the red panda appear within the marten group. At most we see a monophyletic group of the marten and panda families. Cserhati conflates monophyly and belonging to the same family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem: how did a paper as bad as this ever get through review and published?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/wgks_heat_maps_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wgks heat map graphic&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The whole genome k-mers signature heat map used in the two papers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creation-research-society-quarterly-paper&quot;&gt;Creation Research Society Quarterly paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cserhati bases the search for the baraminological placement of the red panda on three types of data: Whole Genome K-mer Signature (WGKS), sequence analysis on mtDNA and sequence analysis on cytochrome-b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WGKS part is the article is almost identical to the WGKS paragraph in the BMC Genomics paper. The same heat map of the WGKS correlation matrix is presented, but the coloring is reversed: right top figure, darker is higher correlation, and the red panda gives the top right ‘Danish flag’ pattern. Again it is visible that the correlation between red panda and martens is lower than the correlations amongst the martens, and again the significant difference is dismissed. The red panda is held to belong to the marten holobaramin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mtDNA sequences of the same 52 species as in the BMC genomics paper were aligned and the resulting identity matrix showing global sequence similarity was visualized in a heat map. This heat map clearly shows five main groups representing the traditional families: two red panda subspecies, bears, marten family, the three skunks and the two raccoons. The two red panda subspecies form an independent cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cytochrome-b sequences of a total of 51 cat, bear, marten, raccoon and skunk species were aligned. The heat map of the similarity matrix shows a clear split between the cat species and all other species, in line with classical systematics. The red panda does not cluster with the marten family according to the heat map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the data do not support including the red panda in the marten family. Yet, Cserhati judges that the panda belongs to the marten holobaramin. Of course, Cserhati might define a holobaramin containing two families, the marten family and the red panda family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all baraminological literature, statistical clustering to different clusters is assumed to indicate unbridgeable biological discontinuity. The reasoning obscures the discontinuity between biology and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oorsprong.info/wetenschapper-lost-creationistisch-biosystematisch-raadsel-van-de-rode-panda-ailurus-fulgens-op/&quot;&gt;A Dutch creationist website&lt;/a&gt; that recommends Cserhati’s work on the red panda wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cserhati’s work can stand as a model for how to do creation research. First, find funding for a detailed study within the creation paradigm (here, Creation Research Society Grant #62). Second, publish the results in a standard naturalistic science journal. Then, provide a more detailed study in a creation science journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, play the system, aiming for respectability for creationist writing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gerdien de Jong</name></author><summary type="html">Gerdien de Jong was until her retirement Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at Utrecht University A Red Panda, Ailurus fulgens, wondering what part of the tree it's on.

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-physical information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the article, the authors look ahead, towards a future Design Science. We read in the last paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences until now have been able to initiate, in terms of complex structures having non-physical information as input (Ratzsch, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thorvaldsen and Hössjer refer to a book chapter by philosopher Del Ratzsch, who discusses the epistemological question of whether science can in principle exclude non-material explanations&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. If you now open the book and look at what Del Ratzsch has actually written, you read on page 356:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences have been able to generate. Historically, design-linked ideas have provided such resources and those resources have been, and continue to be, scientifically fruitful in biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is deplorable. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have distorted the quote so that it has come to mean something completely different. Del Ratzsch does not mention “non-physical information” in his text at all. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have invented that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheating is also revealing. Steinar Thorvaldsen is a professor of Information Science, and if “non-physical information” had been a term used in the field, he would of course have referred to the scientific literature. Instead, a quote attributed to a philosopher has been fabricated. It is an acknowledgement that “non-physical information” does not exist as an established scientific concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what in the world could one imagine “non-physical information” to be? The information processing in any case I’ve heard of is always tied to matter of some kind: a brain or a computer. The information is always carried by some material medium, such as visible symbols, sound waves, patterns of magnetization, electromagnetic radiation or something else. The information itself consists, as far as I can understand, of a pattern or structure in the material medium. But how can there be pattern or structure in something that does not exist? Could “non-physical information” somehow float freely in space? Where does it come from? How could it affect matter? How do we even know it exists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Thorvaldsen and Hössjer now want to revolutionize biology as well as information theory, they can come up with some kind of argument. But not; that “non-physical information” would exist is an ad hoc claim, something they grabbed completely out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I wonder about the claim that biologists would need “richer conceptual resources” than what the physical sciences can offer. I can reveal that as a biologist I have never felt such a need in my research. Nor can I recall any colleague ever expressing any desire to go outside the physical sciences, or the matter being discussed at all at conferences or in the scientific literature. These are fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had this been a normal scientific article, the authors would have justified the sensational claims they make in the quote above, and discussed them in relation to the scientific literature. But this isn’t a normal scientific paper, so they don’t. It is not wrong to speculate, but Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have clearly lost touch with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment by Ola Hössjer&lt;/strong&gt;
June 29, 2021 3:39 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4: What is information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his fourth article, Erkell discusses the concept of information, which has been a basis of telecommunications theory for over 70 years. In TH2020, we argue that information has great potential to also be used in biology, as well. This is much in line with what I wrote earlier, since information is closely related to our proposed method of demonstrating fine-tuning&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. At the end of our article, we write that “non-physical information” is a concept that can make valuable contributions to biology, as one of several input parameters of biological models. In this context, we refer to an article by the American philosophy professor Del Ratzsch, who argues that design can make valuable contributions to biology. Erkell is very critical of our way of referring to Del Ratsch, and writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is deplorable. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have distorted the quote so that it has come to mean something completely different. Del Ratzsch does not mention “non-physical information” in his text at all. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have invented that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The cheating is also revealing. Steinar Thorvaldsen is a professor of Information Science, and if “non-physical information” had been a term used in the field, he would of course have referred to the scientific literature. Instead, a quote attributed to a philosopher has been fabricated. It is an acknowledgement that “non-physical information” does not exist as an established scientific concept.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what in the world could one imagine “non-physical information” to be? The information processing in any case I’ve heard of is always tied to matter of some kind: a brain or a computer. The information is always carried by some material medium, such as visible symbols, sound waves, patterns of magnetization, electromagnetic radiation or something else. The information itself consists, as far as I can understand, of a pattern or structure in the material medium. But how can there be pattern or structure in something that does not exist? Could “non-physical information” somehow float freely in space? Where does it come from? How could it affect matter? How do we even know it exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these paragraphs, Erkell mixes up two concepts, on one hand how information is conveyed and stored, and on the other hand how information arises. I completely agree with Erkell that information does not float in the air but it is rather stored in some physical medium. What we are referring to in TH2020 is the emergence of information, and this can either be physical and non-physical. A few sentences before we use the term non-physical information in TH2020, we write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One rather needs a specificity function that, although of non-physical origin, can be quantified and measured empirically in terms of physical properties such as functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting our introduced concept of non-physical information into context, it is thus clear that we refer to the emergence and not the storage of information. Erkell further claims that we invented the concept of non-physical information. But while information theorists may not use that exact term, it’s still not taken out of thin air. In this context I would like to especially mention the Italian philosophy professor Luciano Floridi’s division into different types of information. Floridi distinguishes between “environmental information” and “semantic information”, where only the former type of information has a physical origin (such as cloud formations that give us information about the weather an hour later).&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Semantic information, on the other hand, conveys a meaning to the recipient , and unless one has a reductionist worldview (which Del Ratzsch, by the way, does not have), it is natural to identify semantic information with non-physical information, even if Floridi does not use the latter term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic information can in turn be divided into instructions/algorithms and factual information (statements of fact). As far as I know, no one has succeeded in showing that semantic information can arise through purely material processes. Since biological systems (e.g., the DNA code) convey semantic information, it is hardly far-fetched to claim that this concept constitutes a valuable tool in biology. For this reason, semantic information that can be measured physically and quantified (so that it forms the basis of falsifiable hypotheses) constitutes a potentially important type of specification. In TH2020 we write that a very interesting future research area is to find different ways to quantify semantic (or non-physical) information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Part 4, Erkell discusses whether biologists need to include non-physical explanatory hypotheses in their models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then I wonder about the claim that biologists would need “richer conceptual resources” than what the physical sciences can offer. I can reveal that as a biologist I have never felt such a need in my research. Nor can I recall any colleague ever expressing any desire to go outside the physical sciences, or the matter being discussed at all at conferences or in the scientific literature. These are fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regard this as a very weak argument. Whether non-material processes are relevant in biology is not primarily determined by what the majority of biologists write about in their research papers or speak about at their conferences. First, it is mainly for those parts of biology that deal with questions of origin, that meaning and other non-material concepts have a great potential. Secondly, biology as a science is strongly governed by a secular way of thinking (see Part 5) and it is therefore hardly surprising that a large proportion of all biologists do not use non-material explanations as working tools. Third, many natural scientists have argued for long that information has a non-physical origin. The founder of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, believed that information cannot be attributed to matter or energy, and the well-known American physicist John Archibald Wheeler , in the same spirit, coined the concept “It from Bit”, that is, everything originates from information, measured in the unit of bits&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, there are several biologists who point out that the concepts of meaning and codes are important tools in biology, something that Erkell does not seem to have noticed.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more detail, if P=P(f(X)≥f(x), given M2) is the probability of randomly generating a system X that is at least as specified as the observed system x, given the naturalistic model M2, then I=-log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P) denotes the degree of functional information in the system, see Hazen, R.M. et al. (2007). Functional information and the emergence of bio-complexity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States 104 (suppl 1), 8574-8581. In order to demonstrate fine-tuning, it is required that the functional information I is large enough. This in turn requires that a function f, that quantifies the degree of specification is defined (step (b) of our fine-tuning definition) and that the probability P of achieving this specification by chance under model M2 is small (step a in our fine-tuning definition). If the specification function f also conveys a meaning to the recipient, then I corresponds to semantic (or non-physical) information. Note that functional and semantic information differ from syntactic information (or Shannon information) in that the probability P must be tied to a specification f.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reply by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/strong&gt;
September 8, 2021 6:24 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of information constantly comes up in discussions about ID. You mean that I make a mistake when I do not distinguish between information and the origin of the information. But you yourselves don’t make that distinction in TH2020; it appeared in your comment above. The cause of the information could thus be non-physical, and that the information could then be transferred and stored in physical media. But how would that happen? How can something non-physical (whatever that would be) control physical processes? To get anywhere here, you need to solve the body-soul problem, a philosophical classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was interesting that you confirm that “non-physical” information does not exist as a concept within the established information theory. Instead, in your article you have referred to a philosopher who does not use the term. In your reply above, you now refer to another philosopher who also does not use the term. I maintain that you plucked the non-physical information out of thin air. Because what should one say when you write that “it [is] natural to identify semantic information with non-physical information”. Is it? Semantic information is interpreted in our material brains, and in that sense is physical, or at least associated with physical structures. From what I understand, it also cannot exist without physical structures. To me, it doesn’t feel natural at all to identify semantic information with non-physical information. That the thought feels natural to you, I suspect, is due to the fact that you, as a dualist, place the thinking in a non-material soul. In any case, mere emotion is not enough to establish revolutionary concepts such as “non-physical information”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also write that “biological systems (for example the DNA code) convey semantic information”. I want to question that. Semantic information conveys a meaning to the receiver, which presupposes a consciousness that interprets the information. Who/what interprets the DNA code in the cell? The ribosome, which would be the structure that “interprets” the DNA information during protein synthesis, does not think. Each step in the process occurs through chance and physical necessity. Protein synthesis is well studied, and we can see that its various steps consist of physical interactions between physical molecules. The same goes for every other cellular process I know of. Strictly speaking, we do not need information theory to understand the molecular processes in the cell. The fact that we still use the concept of information is due, I believe, to the fact that we are already familiar with it and that it makes it easier for us to understand how the cell works. Having said that, I still hope that information theory can be developed so that we get new tools to understand what happens in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You further write “Whether non-material processes are relevant in biology is not primarily determined by what the majority of biologists write about in research articles or speak about at conferences”. It is true that biologists, like everyone else, have their limitations, but who would be better placed to judge biology’s need for non-material explanations?

(part 4) November 13, 2020 by Lars Johan Erkell Non-physical information? Towards the end of the article, the authors look ahead, towards a future Design Science. We read in the last paragraph: Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences until now have been able to initiate, in terms of complex structures having non-physical information as input (Ratzsch, 2010). Thorvaldsen and Hössjer refer to a book chapter by philosopher Del Ratzsch, who discusses the epistemological question of whether science can in principle exclude non-material explanations1. If you now open the book and look at what Del Ratzsch has actually written, you read on page 356: Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences have been able to generate. Historically, design-linked ideas have provided such resources and those resources have been, and continue to be, scientifically fruitful in biology. This is deplorable. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have distorted the quote so that it has come to mean something completely different. Del Ratzsch does not mention “non-physical information” in his text at all. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have invented that. The cheating is also revealing. Steinar Thorvaldsen is a professor of Information Science, and if “non-physical information” had been a term used in the field, he would of course have referred to the scientific literature. Instead, a quote attributed to a philosopher has been fabricated. It is an acknowledgement that “non-physical information” does not exist as an established scientific concept. But what in the world could one imagine “non-physical information” to be? The information processing in any case I’ve heard of is always tied to matter of some kind: a brain or a computer. The information is always carried by some material medium, such as visible symbols, sound waves, patterns of magnetization, electromagnetic radiation or something else. The information itself consists, as far as I can understand, of a pattern or structure in the material medium. But how can there be pattern or structure in something that does not exist? Could “non-physical information” somehow float freely in space? Where does it come from? How could it affect matter? How do we even know it exists?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Breakthrough for Intelligent Design?

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Johan Erkell (with comment by Ola Hössjer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miracles as science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thorvaldsen and Hössjer give a number of examples of systems that they
think are suitable for the statistical model we discussed in the previous
post. One of the examples concerns human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One may also study the more restricted problem of human/chimp ancestry, and compare a model M2 with common ancestry of the two species, with a unique origin model M1, according to which each species is founded by one single couple (Sanford and Carter, 2014; Hössjer et al., 2016a; 2016b, Carter et al., 2018, Hössjer and Gauger, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Thorvaldsen and Hössjer raise this question as suitable to study with their statistical model, we shall look at it more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question they ask is whether it is possible that humanity has its
origins in a single couple, a man and a woman. It is of course about Adam
and Eve, even if they are not mentioned by name - otherwise there is
hardly any reason to ask the question. The common scientific view is that
humans did not originate in two individuals, but that our species passed
a bottleneck perhaps 70,000 years ago, when there were perhaps 10,000
individuals. One can of course imagine that the bottleneck was only two
individuals, but to be able to explain the genetic variation we see
today, we then have to extend the time to 500,000 years or more. This is
not acceptable for a young earth creationist scenario. There, creation
must have taken place 6,000 to 10,000 years ago if you want to 
read the Bible literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ola Hössjer is a co-author in three of the referenced
articles: “Genetic Modeling of Human History Part 1: Comparison of Common
Descent and Unique Origin Approaches” and “Genetic Modeling of Human
History Part 2: A Unique Origin Algorithm”, both from 2016. Here he
reports that he, along with two co-authors, developed a population
genetic model to simulate human descent. Together with biologist Ann
Gauger (who is affiliated with the Discovery Institute), he has also
written “A Single-Couple Human Origin is Possible” from 2019, where they
developed their earlier model. They write that an origin from a single
couple 500,000 years ago is consistent with the model, but that only
small changes in the model can give an age of 100,000 years or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three articles are published in the online journal BIO-complexity, published by the Discovery Institute, the central organization of the ID movement. The journal is not recognized as a “real” scientific journal. For example, it is not included in the scientific database SCOPUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Genetic Modeling of Human History Part 1” we read on the first page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We argue that a unique origin model where humanity arose from one single couple with created diversity seems to explain the data at least as well, if not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ola Hössjer and his co-authors thus say that their model that humans
originated in a single couple matches the data better than the standard
evolutionary model. But what data? All you find is qualitative reasoning
about published data of various kinds. Neither of the two articles with
the title “Genetic Modeling of Human History” contains any &quot;Genetic
Modeling&quot;; no quantitative data, no results from simulations with the
model developed. The approach is recognizable from Thorvaldsen and
Hössjer's current article (see the first post in the series). Here the
authors also pretend to have results they don't have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote also mentions &quot;created diversity&quot;. Now what is that? I have
never heard of such a thing before. The text discusses five different
mechanisms for how genetic variation can develop and be limited. But then
it introduces a sixth possibility. The authors write on page 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… But if an intelligent designer is invoked as a possible explanation, and if humanity originates from one single couple, it is possible that their chromosomes were created with considerable diversity from the beginning [19,20]. This gives us a sixth mechanism of genetic change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;VI. Created founder diversity is biologically plausible for DNA of non-sex chromosomes. Since there are four copies of each non-sex chromosome in two individuals, we may think of one of the founding male’s two copies as a reference or template for the other three. All differences between his reference chromosome and the other three founder chromosomes can be thought of as a very large number of mutations, all of which occurred in one generation. Since the founding pair had three copies of the X-chromosome (one in the man and two in the woman), for the same reason they may also have been different. Some founder diversity is possible for mitochondrial DNA as well. Since the founding female carried hundreds of mitochondria that could have been diverse, it is possible that she passed on some of that diversity to her daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genome contains two copies of each gene. The idea is that Adam and
Eve would have been created with two different variants of each gene in
their DNA, which together would give four variants. That would increase
genetic variation so much that one could imagine a creation 6,000 to
10,000 years ago. References 19 and 20 are not to the scientific
literature, but to two creationist journals. The first of the two
articles does not justify why introducing an engineered genetic variation
would be scientifically justified. However, the other one, “On the Origin
of Eukaryotic Species' Genotypic and Phenotypic Diversity: Genetic
Clocks, Population Growth Curves, and Comparative Nuclear Genome Analyzes
Suggest Created Heterozygosity in Combination with Natural Processes as a
Major Mechanism”, by Nathaniel Jeanson and Jason Lisle, does. They write
on p. 86-87:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No known non-miraculous mechanism exists that could play a role in this process, and invoking miracles at every juncture without biblical or scientific justification quickly moves a hypothesis from the realm of science to the realm of ad hoc speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…
On an individual organism level, hypotheses must invoke observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes. 
…
Again, observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes must be invoked, or the hypothesis quickly drifts into the realm of the ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hypothesis could thus be justified either scientifically or with the support of the Bible. However, I find no discussion of exactly how the Bible can justify God creating Adam and Eve with maximum genetic variation. Ola Hössjer and co-authors thus refer to a created variation that is not justified either scientifically or biblically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But surely this is a convenient explanation. Invoking a designer suddenly
makes it possible that genetic variation may be greater than established
science admits, and that Adam and Eve may have lived 6,000 to 10,000
years ago. It is not seen as necessary to show that there really is a
designer or that the designer really had the desire to create exactly the
genetic variation that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are problems with this model. Without going into the genetics, one
can, for example, state that in this model there can be a maximum of four
gene variants - alleles - of a certain gene. However, there are gene
families with thousands of alleles. Where do they come from? But once you
have started to explain things with miracles, you can surely solve those
problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where does the designer come from? Out of thin air. A designer has been invented that creates genetic variation to solve the problem that Adam and Eve must not have lived hundreds of thousands of years ago. And thus they have completely left science and floated out into the world of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ola Hössjer was faced with a new statistical model that was based on
an unproven theorem, I believe he would react sharply. Theorems must be
proven, otherwise you cannot know that they are true. If there is any
part in the derivation of the model that is unproven, it cannot be used.
Grabbing something out of thin air – a theorem or something else – is
called ad hoc assumption and is not considered good scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't get your theory together, you can't just pull something to
save it. All parts of a mathematical derivation or a biological theory
must be based on knowledge, not on grabbing something out of thin air
when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this is exactly what Ola Hössjer and co-authors are doing. The introduction of a supernatural designer makes their work lose all scientific credibility and thus all scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me add that in principle one can consider a designer as a scientific
explanation, provided it is known for sure that the designer exists, and
has such properties that they can explain a certain phenomenon. If we
have actual knowledge about the designer (as we have about the five
genetic mechanisms discussed) we can use that knowledge to explain
things. But in this case we have no knowledge of the designer at all. And
then we cannot use design as an explanation. at all. And then we cannot use design as an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment by Ola Hössjer&lt;/strong&gt;
June 29, 2021 3:19 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: Miracles and Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part 3, Erkell makes a detour and comments on a number of articles on the origin of man that I wrote in collaboration with Ann Gauger and Colin Reeves&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In these articles we use the design model M1 that was described in Part 2 in a creationist context. More precisely, our model M1 assumes that all humans are descended from a first couple, Adam and Eve. The model thus includes the aforementioned microevolutionary mechanisms (i)-(v), as well as Adam and Eve being created with genetic variation (vi). In other words, according to this model, Adam has two genetically different copies of each non-sex chromosome, and so does Eve. Thus, in the first founder generation we get four genetically different variants of each non-sex chromosome. The degree of genetic dissimilarity between these variants, i.e. the degree of created variation, is a parameter that can be varied in the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell calls our creationist model M1 a miracle model (which, by the way, I think is a good name)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), and he has similar high demands on this model as he had on the design model in the previous section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A hypothesis could thus be justified either scientifically or with the support of the Bible. However, I find no discussion of exactly how the Bible can justify God creating Adam and Eve with maximum genetic variation. Ola Hössjer and co-authors thus refer to a created variation that is not justified either scientifically or biblically.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support his thesis, Erkell starts from the quote “On an individual organism level, hypotheses must invoke observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes” by the creationists Jeanson and Lisle.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; I support this formulation, if the purpose is to choose between a creationist model M1 and a naturalistic model M2. But the fact that a hypothesis can be justified based on the Bible does not mean that it is a direct quote from a Bible verse. Erkell has simply misunderstood how creationist research is conducted. In fact, it is perfectly possible to let the Bible inspire the formulation of falsifiable hypotheses. In other words, creationism can be reconciled with the hypothetical deductive method, regardless of whether we start from direct biblical quotes or simply are inspired by the contents of the Bible, according to the following three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Propose a falsifiable hypothesis that partly contains natural explanatory mechanisms and partly explanatory mechanisms that are inspired by the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evaluate and check if the hypothesis in (1) is consistent with data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the agreement in (2) is not good, go back to (1) and propose a better hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Christian, I believe that God wrote two books, the Bible and nature. Therefore, it is ultimately God who is behind what we call “natural explanations” as well as the “biblically motivated explanations”. Of course, one must place the same demands on a creationist model M1 as on a secular model M2. Erkell argues that our proposed creationist miracle model is firstly ad hoc and secondly not falsifiable. I believe that both of these statements are completely wrong. The Bible states that man was created uniquely. Given this, I mean that it is not at all a far-fetched ad hoc assumption to assume that God created Adam and Eve with genetic variation, because He is creative and did not want all men and women to look alike, like monozygotic twins. By creating the first two humans with variation, the risk of inbreeding depression was also reduced when harmful mutations made their way into future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that we only include created variation in our model, not why God created the first two humans with variation. Given this, the model is falsifiable, because then, due to recombinations (iv), our DNA is a mosaic of the four building blocks from each chromosome, with which Adam and Eve were created. Such building blocks, called haplotype blocks, were discovered by secular scientists about 20 years ago. We mention this in two of our articles, with numerous references.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Either Erkell has missed these references or he has not realized that the existence of haplotype blocks makes our miracle model falsifiable. And regardless of whether the haplotype blocks are identified or not, I still believe that our miracle model is falsifiable, since there are indirect methods of testing the presence of created variation by comparing the allele frequency spectra and linkage disequilibrium plots calculated from the data with those predicted by the miracle model M1. This latter approach exactly the one we use in one of our publications to test M1 against data.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;  However, Erkell (in Part 5 of his article series) objects to our way of fitting the miracle model to the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you add an unknown designer as a sixth mechanism. Then all opportunities to conduct a fact-based discussion disappear; we have no idea when or how such a designer would intervene. Hössjer and his colleagues seem to assume that the designer would create just enough genetic variation that their model fits. How can they know that? How can they test their model? It’s not possible. You have simply invented a designer who has the qualities you want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Erkell confuses two things, firstly, whether the miracle model M1 is falsifiable or not, which I have already commented on, and secondly, how the adaptation of the model to data has been done. All statistical models contain unknown parameters, so does our miracle model. This is precisely why the data is used to estimate the degree of created variation. Our approach is very similar to an evolutionary biologist who fits a naturalistic model M2 to data by estimating mutation rates, population sizes, and recombination rates. Of course, it is possible to overfit if one uses a model with too many parameters, without validating it. But in my joint article with Ann Gauger, on the contrary, we used a very simple model with created variation, but without geographic variation (v). We also managed to get a good fit of our miracle model to data, if Adam and Eve lived several hundred thousand years ago. However, we write that with a larger (and more realistic) variant of the miracle model, the age of the first two people can probably be lowered significantly. In addition, it is perfectly possible to test the miracle model by first estimating parameters on a data set (a so-called training of the model) and then evaluating how well the obtained model adapts to another data set (a so-called validation of the model).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell finally delivers a third critique of the miracle model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are problems with this model. Without going into the genetics, one can for example state that in this model there can be a maximum of four gene variants - alleles - of a certain gene. However, there are gene families with thousands of alleles. Where do they come from? But if you start to explain things with miracles, you can certainly solve those problems too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rather astonishing statement from a biologist. In fact, it is perfectly possible to explain gene families with a large number of alleles in a model where Adam and Eve were created with variation. Although there were only four raw copies of each non-sex chromosome in the first generation, mutations (i) and recombination (iv) in future generations can generate a large number of variants of different genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell concludes, in Part 3 of his article series, by asking how I, as a mathematician, can allow models with ad hoc assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“f Ola Hössjer was faced with a new statistical model that was based on
an unproven theorem, I believe he would react sharply. Theorems must be
proven, otherwise you cannot know that they are true. If there is any
part in the derivation of the model that is unproven, it cannot be used.
Grabbing something out of thin air – a theorem or something else – is
called ad hoc assumption and is not considered good scientific practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much to say about these sentences. First, Erkell confuses mathematics (a deductive science) with biology (an empirical or inductive science). In mathematics, one starts from axioms (assumptions of faith) and proves, given these axioms, various statements. Here, the demands on accuracy are high, because a single small error can overturn an entire proof. However, there are no requirements for a theorem of mathematics to correspond to reality (despite this, mathematics has nevertheless proven to be very useful). In biology, the aim is instead to adapt models to empirical data, using the hypothetico-deductive method (and here mathematics comes in as a tool). It is therefore never possible to prove that a biological theory is true. On the other hand, if models that do not explain data well are falsified we may be left with plausible models that so far have survived all tests. Of course, even in biology you have to be strict when proposing and testing models against data, but as I have shown above, our miracle model is firstly not ad hoc and secondly it is falsifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our sixth mechanism for genetic change, created variation (iv), assumes that this variation is part of God’s creation. However, miracles are generally defined as exceptions to the laws of nature that God has created already, see for example Keener, C.S. (2011), Miracles, the credibility of the New Testament accounts, Baker Academics, Grand Rapids, Hössjer, O. (2018). Becoming a Christian, Combining prior belief, evidence, and will. Wipf and Stock Publishers, Eugene, OR, and Grenholm (2019), Documented Miracles, Sjöberg Publishers. Alternatively, all of God’s creation can be seen as a miracle. For these reasons I don’t mind using the name miracle model for our creationist explanatory model of human genetic variation, as suggested by Erkell.

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See section 3C of Hössjer et al. (2016a) and section 1.3 of Hössjer et al. (2016b). Note, however, that created variation can be defined in different ways. For example, all of Eve’s egg cells, which were with her from the beginning, may have been created differently. In our articles (see Footnote 3) we have chosen to make the model of created variation as simple as possible, assuming that all of Eve’s eggs were genetically identical. However, one can think of different (falsifiable) models for created variation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reply by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/strong&gt;
September 8, 2021 6:17 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we return to the question of how to formulate scientific hypotheses. I refer to my discussion in the post “Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design” https://biologg.wordpress.com/2021/09/08/vetenskap-hypoteser-och-intelligent-design/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you find it astonishing that I, as a biologist, do not agree that today’s genetic diversity could be explained on the basis that Adam and Eve must have lived 6000 years ago. But I’m not the only one who thinks so. I assume that you know that Steve Schaffner and Joshua Swamidass, with their respective allele frequency spectra and recombination analysis, concluded that from a genetic point of view it is indeed quite possible that Adam and Eve could have existed, but that they must have lived at least 500,000 years ago (see eg http://richardbuggs.com/2021/03/15/video-adam-eve-and-human-genetic-diversity/). In your own article “A Single-Couple Human Origin is Possible” (https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2019.1) you and Ann Gauger arrive at the same results. So why are you surprised that I don’t believe genetics shows a creation 6000 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical point here is whether there are genetic mechanisms that in
6000 years can generate today's genetic variation from a single couple.
You write &quot;Even if there were only four raw copies of each non-sex
chromosome in the first generation, mutations (i) and recombination (iv)
in future generations can generate a large number of variants of
different genes&quot;. Here's one thing I have to ask you: one of the main
points of young earth creationism is that mutations are basically always
harmful and destructive. They would cause irreversible losses of
&quot;information&quot; and an ever-increasing &quot;genetic entropy&quot;. Are you prepared
to argue contrary to this that mutations and recombinations (which are a
form of random mutation) can generate new, functional alleles of a gene?
HLA-B, the gene with most variation to my knowledge, was reported in
June 2021 to have 8,181 alleles. So can a blind process of random
mutation and selection generate thousands of functional, new gene
variants?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lars Johan Erkell</name></author><summary type="html">The text is a pun in Swedish: &quot;Logg&quot; means something like a ship´s log or a logbook.

Since Thorvaldsen and Hössjer raise this question as suitable to study with their statistical model, we shall look at it more closely.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Black ant</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/unidentified-black-ant.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Black ant" /><published>2022-11-21T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-11-21T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/unidentified-black-ant</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/unidentified-black-ant.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Al Denelsbeck&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

of his “Breakthrough for Intelligent Design?” series were made.  He has requested that we post it here after 
the second post in that series, to explain his position in that post on what can be considered legitimate 
science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central point in the discussion I have with Ola Hössjer in the posts entitled &quot;Breakthrough for
intelligent design?&quot; concerns the limits for what can be considered legitimate science. Since my
responses to his comments on this matter are too long for the comments section, I have made a
separate post on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central question is how to formulate a hypothesis, that is, a suggested explanation for a
phenomenon. Hypotheses are not formulated in an arbitrary way; you don't just grab something out
of the air. A hypothesis should be based on prior knowledge. It should also be falsifiable, which
means that it must be possible to show that it is incorrect. The scientific work then consists of testing
the hypothesis. Whether it proves to be true or false, something new has been learned. The
important thing here is that the hypothesis is formulated in such a way that it can be tested in
practice with a clear-cut result. If you cannot do that, you cannot learn anything new. And if you
cannot test your hypotheses, you cannot root your theories in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just because a hypothesis is falsifiable does not mean that it is scientific. For example, &quot;the
Moon is a cheese&quot; is a falsifiable (and falsified) hypothesis. But pure nonsense. If we want to give it a
scientific touch, we can formulate it as a classical syllogism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premise 1: The Moon is yellow, round and has craters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premise 2: A cut cheese is yellow, round and has pits that look like craters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The Moon is a cheese&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is not just grabbed out of thin air; it is based on an analogy. But it is still nonsense.
My point here is that just because a hypothesis is falsifiable, or is expressed in a formally correct
manner, that does not mean it is plausible or even makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of a falsifiable hypothesis that is scientifically acceptable, let us take a classic: Darwin's
hypothesis of the common descent of life forms. It implies, among other implications, that older
forms must lie below younger forms in the fossil record. In other words, a fossil of a reliably
identified and reliably dated rabbit (or any other modern mammal) may not be found in Cambrian
deposits, i.e. from a time long before the first mammals emerged. Despite millions of fossils being
unearthed, nothing has yet been found to disprove Darwin's hypothesis. Still, in principle it could
happen, and that would be a fundamental blow to the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can hear ID proponents argue that ID can also make falsifiable hypotheses. Stephen Meyer
devotes an entire appendix to discussing the matter in his 2009 book &lt;em&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/em&gt;. He writes
on page 482: &quot;… the theory of intelligent design makes predictions about the kind of features we are
likely to find in living systems if they were in fact intelligently designed&quot;. What is important here is
the wording &quot;we are likely to find&quot; - ID's predictions are thus based on what one might vaguely
expect to find. Not on what one &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; find or on what one &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;/em&gt; find, i.e. not on any compelling
predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that one cannot clearly falsify an ID hypothesis. As an example, let us take an ID-inspired
hypothesis that Meyer puts forward: &quot;The functional sequences of amino acids within amino 
acid-sequence space should be extremely rare rather than common&quot;. He argues that of all possible
combinations of the amino acids that make up proteins, there should be very few combinations that
result in functional protein structures. The first problem is that Meyer does not give a clear limit for
what would be extremely rare and what would not, so the question is impossible to decide in
practice - &quot;extremely rare&quot; can be interpreted in very different ways. The second, and bigger,
problem is that there is no logical connection to a designer - how do we know that the designer
decided that there must be only a few working combinations? We don't. So even if we could confirm
the hypothesis, it would not tell us anything about whether proteins were designed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ID hypothesis is clearly not about proving ID, but about ruling out an evolutionary explanation. If
it could be shown that there were extremely few working combinations of amino acids, this would be
seen as an argument against the theory of evolution (which, by the way, it is not). In other words,
Meyer tries to demonstrate &quot;non-evolution&quot; and sees this as a sign of design. This is a classic fallacy -
the fact that one explanation does not hold up does not mean that another explanation must be
correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meyer in his appendix has a list of twelve &quot;ID-inspired&quot; predictions of which the above example was
the last one. The other eleven suffer from the same weaknesses. Some of them are pure arguments
against evolutionary processes and have nothing to do with design. Others assume that the designer
is working with a particular type of design which you then want to identify. But you cannot know
what type of design the designer uses, so what you are actually testing is the idea you have about
how the designer should work. Without actual knowledge of the designer, it is impossible to know
how to formulate precise hypotheses. Everything becomes pure conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of empirical work based on a hypothetical designer, consider a study of the impact of
intercessory prayer on the recovery of patients who have undergone a particular type of heart
surgery.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is a large study with 1800 patients, carried out according to all the rules of the art. The
end result was that no significant effect of prayer was seen. Does this mean that prayer has been
shown not to work? Not at all. The results only show that intercession does not work with the
particular experimental design chosen. Perhaps it would have worked with other patients, other
experimental groups, other control groups, other prayer rituals, other people praying? We don't
know. Since we have no concrete knowledge of the designer, we do not know how the experiment
should be set up to show with certainty the effect of intercessory prayer. We can guess endlessly.
This is not how good hypothesis testing is done - that requires precise, testable hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us leave the hypotheses and move on to what is required of a scientific explanation. Explaining
something means clearly demonstrating the causes of some phenomenon; you connect cause and
effect. You also have to show how the cause leads to the observed phenomenon. A good
explanation, then, involves linking a phenomenon to a known cause through a known mechanism.
Darwin's theory of evolution is a good example. His idea of common descent was quickly accepted by
his contemporaries; it was so obvious that it explained the patterns of nature well. But with natural
selection it was not so. Darwin could not explain the mechanisms of heredity, which was a
prerequisite for understanding natural selection. That is why not many people fully accepted his
theory. However, by the turn of the 20th century, the mechanisms of genetics were starting to be
elucidated, so now the process of evolution was being understood. But it was still not clear exactly
how evolution happened. It wasn't until population genetics had developed sufficiently in the 1930s
and 40s that the theory became widely accepted. By then, the whole chain was clear: known causes
(heredity and variation) caused a known phenomenon (evolution) through a known mechanism
(natural selection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we can understand the entire causal chain. We can understand it at the molecular level as well
as at the population level. We know the molecules and processes that cause evolution. We can
observe and measure them, which allows us to have an evidence-based discussion about the
importance of different factors, and how well different models fit reality. That is how it should be
with a good scientific explanation. It also allows us to formulate and test new hypotheses based on
the knowledge we already have - for example, can cooperation and helpfulness be explained in
evolutionary terms? It turns out that it can. The theory of inclusive fitness provides a robust
evolutionary explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to an ID explanation of how a complex biological structure would arise. The cause, the
designer, is unknown, and so are the mechanisms by which the design would be implemented. Thus,
we cannot assess how plausible the ID explanation is, or how it compares to other explanations. An
explanation based on unknown causes and unknown mechanisms is, strictly speaking, no explanation
at all - it doesn't make us any wiser. It provides no concrete knowledge. It has no explanatory value.
Nor does it provide a reliable basis for further hypotheses. If you are already firmly convinced that
there is a designer, it may work as a religiously based explanation, but it is scientifically uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fuzziness of ID explanations is characteristic. It is also reflected in the lack of precision in the
concepts used. For example, &quot;complex specified information&quot; is not defined in a way that makes it
measurable or practically useful. Similarly, it is impossible to clearly determine whether a structure is
irreducibly complex or not - distinct criteria are lacking. It is obviously impossible to conduct
meaningful research with such fuzzy concepts. Yet ID proponents refer to these concepts as if they
were clear, meaningful and established. But they are definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is clear: ID cannot provide the kind of mechanistic explanations that are the basis of a
scientific theory. Thus ID cannot compete with established science, and can never be a scientific
alternative. On the other hand, ID could be a complementary explanation on another level: one is
free to imagine a governing intelligence behind all the mysteries of existence, while science provides
the mechanistic explanations of how the world actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you calculate design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stands out about Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s work, and what makes me write these blog posts, is that they raise the question of how one could demonstrate fine-tuning and design using scientific methods. In any case, how one could imagine doing so; it doesn’t get more concrete than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thorvaldsen and Hössjer carefully discuss the statistical methods they use, or rather believe that one can use. The main line is – as always with ID – that you try to support ID by primarily criticizing the theory of evolution. But you cannot prove theory A by showing that theory B is bad. The authors are also aware of this. They write in section 6.3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, one may argue that the most suitable approach of science is to compare the best explanations found so far within two competing worldviews. This naturally leads to model selection. … It is possible for some problems to suggest a design model M1 that competes with the currently most promising naturalistic model M2, in terms of which model explains the data the best.
The authors therefore want to compare an evolutionary model with a design model by using statistical methods to determine which of them is more probable. And it is clear that the intention is to make the comparison based on concrete data. But from which models, and from which data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their critique of evolutionary theory, a number of well-known themes are addressed, primarily “irreducible complexity” on several levels; in individual proteins, in protein complexes and in entire networks. Also the “Cambrian explosion” and the so-called the waiting time problem is addressed. What these have in common is that the authors believe that the structures of life are so complex and thus so improbable that they could never arise naturally. However, this is not a view shared by established science – here the arguments are seen as contrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now is, in practical terms, these problems could be calculated. A question that has been dealt with extensively - and which is probably the easiest to calculate - concerns the probability that a functioning protein will be able to arise through naturalistic mechanisms. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer mention in section 4.2 two strategies for doing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is based on the fact that protein consists of one or more chains of amino acids that must be in a certain sequence. Since there are 20 different amino acids to choose from, there are countless combinations. In a small protein consisting of 150 amino acids, the different amino acids can be combined in 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt; different ways. These are astronomically large numbers; the probability that the “right” combination would occur by chance is vanishingly small. The big problem with this strategy, however, is that no sane biologist believes that proteins form in this random way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary biological view is instead that the first enzymes consisted of short peptide chains with a small number of amino acids – it is known that such chains can have enzymatic activity.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; That such peptide chains could be formed by chance is not unreasonable. They may not have been as efficient as today’s enzymes, but if they had sufficient enzyme activity, they would have been selected and evolved into larger and more efficient molecules. So no one believes that proteins are formed in the way that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer are suggesting. It is a little strange that they mention this bizarre idea at all. It is completely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other strategy is to set up a hypothetical evolutionary tree for how a certain protein might have evolved, and then calculate the probability of that process. But there is a lot of knowledge that is missing in order to be able to make credible calculations of this kind, not least because we have to reckon with an evolution that extends over billions of years. We would need detailed knowledge of which organisms are involved, mutation frequencies, population sizes, selection pressure and much else that is impossible to know in retrospect. This is not a realistic path. Nor, as far as I know, has anyone attempted to set up any detailed scenario of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is that it is not practically possible to statistically calculate the probability that a protein could evolve via natural mechanisms. The difficulties are so enormous that it will probably never be possible. And yet this was the simplest of the cases discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s strategy for demonstrating fine-tuning is based on a statistical comparison between a naturalistic model M2 and a design model M1. We then need to calculate the probability for both models in order to compare them. We have already seen that it is practically impossible to calculate the probability that a complex biological structure can arise according to a naturalistic model. But how to calculate the likelihood of a design model? It is something the authors wisely do not go into. Here we are in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to calculate the probability of how a complex biological structure can arise, we must have a credible and detailed model of the process. This also applies if there is a conscious design behind it. We must therefore have knowledge of the designer in order to assess the probability that he/she/it wanted the design exactly the way we see it. This requires detailed knowledge – we need to understand exactly how the designer thinks, what the intentions, plans and means are. In order to make statistical calculations, we must have actual data, numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design proponents, however, are careful not to say anything about who the designer might be, or what qualities the designer might have. This makes it fundamentally impossible to calculate the statistical probability of a design process. So it’s not just practically impossible, as with the naturalistic model, it’s fundamentally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistical model Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have put forward to demonstrate design is misconceived and unworkable – it is based on the unreasonable assumption that it is possible to make a statistical estimate of the probability that an unknown designer would have acted in a certain way. It is a mystery that they chose to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment by Ola Hössjer&lt;/strong&gt;
June 29, 2021 3:00 a.m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2. About counting on design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to estimate the probability that a biological system should have arisen by chance (that is, step (a) of the fine-tuning argument) a naturalistic model M2 is required that describes how the system came about or evolved. The fact that the model is naturalistic means that it only involves natural explanatory mechanisms. When it comes to biological evolution, i.e. the development of complicated life forms from simple single-celled organisms, the five naturalistic mechanisms are usually involved (i) mutations, (ii) genetic drift, i.e. random variation in reproductivity when parents pass on their DNA, (iii) natural selection, (iv) recombinations of genetic material from a pair of parents, and v) the mixing of gene pools caused by geographic migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell claims that it is practically impossible to give a reasonable estimate of the probability that, for example, a protein could have evolved in accordance with a naturalistic model M2. I agree that this is extremely difficult, since such a model must necessarily be complicated, with more or less unknown parameters. Nevertheless, I believe that it is possible to demonstrate the difficulty of naturalistic processes to produce complex structures. If one only focuses on certain properties of the protein, that according to M2 must have evolved, a conservative upper bound can be found for the probability that the protein came about through evolutionary processes. In addition, it is possible to account for the fact that several of the model parameters (such as selection pressure, mutation rate, population sizes, generation times, etc.) are difficult to estimate from data with good accuracy, by performing a so-called sensitivity analysis in order to calculate how the upper bound of the probability for the protein to evolve, changes when the constituent parameters change. If this upper bound of the probability is small for all biologically reasonable values of the model parameters, an argument has been made for the difficulty of the proposed naturalistic model M2 to explain the origin of the protein of interest. I therefore argue, contrary to Erkell, that the first step (a) of our method for detecting fine-tuning is highly feasible in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part (b) of our fine-tuning argument consists in finding a measure f(x) of how specified a biological system x is. As mentioned in the introduction, f(x) focuses on some characteristic that the observer recognizes, which in many cases brings to mind that an intelligent designer is behind the origin of the system. In TH2020 we give several examples of how the system x and its specification f(x) can be chosen. For instance, x may correspond to a protein or a molecular machine, with a specification that tells how many parts that must be in place for x to function. Another example is that f(x) indicates the biological fitness of an organism x, that is, its reproductive capacity. In connection with the latter example, we argue in TH2020 that evolution will eventually break down the genetic material of a species because most mutations are harmful or neutral. The consequence is that the fitness of individuals of the species decreases over time. This in turn means that the probability in (a) becomes very low for an evolutionary model M2, based on the aforementioned mechanisms (i)-(v), to be able to explain that the organism in question arose during millions of years of development, because its genetic material during such a long time would be depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if a naturalistic model M2 has difficulties explaining the emergence of a biological system that contains some form of specification, the question remains whether there is any other better explanatory model. At the end of TH2020, we give examples of design- or creationist-inspired models M1 that we believe have greater possibilities than M2 to explain the emergence of the fine-tuned system. To make such reasoning more rigorous, it is necessary to show that the probability of such a system to emerge is much higher for the design model M1 than for the naturalistic model M2. In the example above, where f(x) corresponds to the biological fitness of an organism x, we refer to various articles where a design model is described, which, in addition to the aforementioned (micro)evolutionary mechanisms (i)-(v) adds a sixth mechanism (vi) in the form of genetic variation in a first created pair, from which all individuals in the species descend. According to such a design model M1, the emergence of species can be explained by a combination of created variation (mechanism (vi)) and short-term, small-scale microevolution (mechanisms (i)-(v)). The problem of genetic depletion is then greatly reduced, since created variation makes it possible to assume that the species arose relatively recently, so that the genetic erosion, caused by the harmful mutations, acted over a much shorter time.sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell is strongly critical of us introducing a design model to explain the emergence of a biological system. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order to be able to calculate the probability of how a complex biological structure can arise, we must have a credible and detailed model of the process. This also applies if there is a conscious design behind it. We must therefore have knowledge of the designer in order to assess the probability that he/she/it wanted the design exactly the way we see it. This requires detailed knowledge – we need to understand exactly how the designer thinks, what the intentions, plans and means are. In order to make statistical calculations, we must have actual data, numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Design proponents, however, are careful not to say anything about who the designer might be, or what qualities the designer might have. This makes it fundamentally impossible to calculate the statistical probability of a design process. So it’s not just practically impossible, as with the naturalistic model, it’s fundamentally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree with Erkell that it is difficult to determine exactly what plans or intentions a designer has. But this is not necessary to know. It is enough to let design-inspired thinking generate concrete falsifiable hypotheses.  It is therefore possible to combine a design-inspired model with the hypothetico-deductive method, which forms the basis of empirical science, according to the following three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Propose a falsifiable hypothesis, which may involve both natural mechanisms and design-inspired parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate (through deduction and induction) and check if the hypothesis in (1) is consistent with the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) If the agreement in (2) is not good, go back to (1) and propose a better hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell makes very far-reaching, not to say unreasonable, demands on the design model, because he does not think that falsifiable hypotheses are enough. He also wants to include characteristics of the designer into the model, that often can be very difficult to test scientifically. Although it is interesting to have a separate conversation about the intentions of the designer, this has rather to do with the interpretation of and the reason for the emergence of the testable hypotheses, which is not required for the hypothetico-deductive method. One can thus use more or less intuitive design arguments to formulate testable hypotheses, without having to test the reasoning that led to the formulation of these hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erkell’s reasoning also backfires like a boomerang on himself. Shouldn’t he make the same rigorous demands on naturalistic models M2, where the interpretation of these models is included? How, for example, should randomness of an evolutionary model be explained? Is it epistemic chance (as a way of describing lack of knowledge), ontological chance (genuine non-determinism) or should quantum mechanics be used to explain the emergence of chance? And in the latter case, which interpretation of quantum mechanics should be used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is usually called Haldane’s dilemma. A historical overview of Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem of Natural selection (which is closely related to Haldane’s Dilemma) is given in Basener W., Cordova S., Hössjer O. and Sanford J. (2021). Dynamical Systems and Fitness Maximization in Evolutionary Biology. In: Sriraman B. (eds) Handbook of the Mathematics of the Arts and Sciences. Running, Cham.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we get into the core of the work, your statistical model to detect fine-tuning/design. It assumes that you can calculate the probability that a biological structure can evolve via natural mechanisms, an extremely difficult task. You write that you can make meaningful estimates of the probability of a protein being able to evolve by doing a sensitivity analysis of an upper estimate of this probability. If the variation of this estimate is small for all biologically plausible values of the involved parameters, one would have an argument for the difficulty of the proposed naturalistic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you get “all biologically reasonable values”? It is not enough to count on a single gene – genes (and proteins) interact in complex networks, and selection pressure acts on the entire network. The interaction between genes is called epistasis, and it must be included in your model. Ecology is also crucial because the selection pressure is entirely dependent on the organism’s environment. The problem is that there are astronomically many possibilities for epistatic (and ecological) interactions, and you have no clues as to which might be the relevant ones. You cannot count on a certain protein “all else being equal”; because the genome is constantly changing, “all else is not equal”. All of this means that you are nowhere near a realistic model of an evolution that has taken place in countless steps over millions or billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from all this, there is also a fundamental flaw in the approach, namely that it assumes the probability of a process with a definite goal in the form of a definite structure (at least that’s how ID advocates tend to calculate). But evolutionary processes have no goal. As far as proteins and protein complexes are concerned, there are a huge number of structures that have the same or similar function, and it is one of these that will be selected. It is thus the probability that the function - not the exact structure - will evolve that is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, you mean that “our method of detecting fine-tuning is highly feasible”. If so, why haven’t you done so? Why don’t you at least have a discussion of which factors would be included in such a calculation, how they should be identified, how they should be estimated, how they should be weighed against each other, etc.? Then—and only then—would this article be interesting. It would be even more interesting if you could succeed with the second part of your method, namely calculating the probability of design. If you are to test the probability that a certain structure is designed, you must know the characteristics of the designer - design is an act of will, and it is the probability of that act of will that you must calculate. And that is of course impossible without in-depth knowledge of the designer. You don’t write anything about how this would work, and that doesn’t surprise me; I suspect you have no idea. At least I don’t have it. But this is necessary if you want to be able to compare M1 and M2. That comparison is the very core of your method. But you comment on it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Erkell makes very far-reaching, not to say unreasonable, demands on the design model, because he is not satisfied with falsifiable hypotheses. Instead, he also wants to include characteristics of the designer that can often be difficult to test scientifically.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no getting away from this: the probability of a design hypothesis includes the probability that a designer really wants to accomplish a certain thing. Without intention no design. If we imagine an omnipotent designer (which you probably do) it is only an act of will; no practical complications exist. But I get curious; you write “characteristics of the designer that can often be difficult to test scientifically”, which must mean that there are actually characteristics of the designer that can be scientifically tested. What are they? How can you test them? Here we get into really central questions about scientific hypotheses. That discussion is so important and extensive that it hardly fits in the comments section. I have therefore written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PandasThumb/pandasthumb.github.io/edit/source/_posts/2022/2022-11-09-erkell8.md&quot;&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; on the matter, “Science, hypotheses and Intelligent Design”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your comment you also touch on completely different things: you talk about “genetic erosion” and refer in a footnote to “Haldane’s dilemma”. Here you are confusing two things. Haldane’s dilemma is not about some kind of erosion 
but about how fast evolution can go, more specifically whether there was enough time for the gene substitutions that must have taken place from the time of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees until today. The genetic erosion you talk about is John Sanford’s genetic entropy, a completely different matter. It would consist of a slow and inevitable genetic decay that would lead to our demise. However, neither Sanford nor anyone else has been able to show that this decay actually occur. Sanford builds on an earlier, now dismissed, idea that a genetic “catastrophe” could occur if enough harmful mutations accumulate in a genome. However, it has never been shown that such catastrophes actually take place, but rather that they do not (Springman, R. et al: Evolution at a High Imposed Mutation Rate: Adaptation Obscures the Load in Phage T7. Genetics (2010)184: 221 –232); Summers, J., Litwin, S.: Examining The Theory of Error Catastrophe. J. Virol., (2006) 80, 20–260). So forget about genetic entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you suggest that I should place the same strict demands on my own research as I do on yours. But that’s exactly what I do - I make the same demands on your research that I myself have to live up to. Regarding your question about chance, I (and my colleagues) assume an ontological chance, since chemical reactions are based on the interaction between elementary particles and these are subject to the quantum laws in their Copenhagen interpretation. This is the basis of the molecular orbital theory, and thus of the chemistry and biology, I was once taught.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lars Johan Erkell</name></author><summary type="html">The text is a pun in Swedish: &quot;Logg&quot; means something like a ship´s log or a logbook.

In any case, how one could imagine doing so; it doesn’t get more concrete than that. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer carefully discuss the statistical methods they use, or rather believe that one can use. The main line is – as always with ID – that you try to support ID by primarily criticizing the theory of evolution. But you cannot prove theory A by showing that theory B is bad. The authors are also aware of this. They write in section 6.3: However, one may argue that the most suitable approach of science is to compare the best explanations found so far within two competing worldviews. This naturally leads to model selection. … It is possible for some problems to suggest a design model M1 that competes with the currently most promising naturalistic model M2, in terms of which model explains the data the best. The authors therefore want to compare an evolutionary model with a design model by using statistical methods to determine which of them is more probable. And it is clear that the intention is to make the comparison based on concrete data. But from which models, and from which data? In their critique of evolutionary theory, a number of well-known themes are addressed, primarily “irreducible complexity” on several levels; in individual proteins, in protein complexes and in entire networks. Also the “Cambrian explosion” and the so-called the waiting time problem is addressed. What these have in common is that the authors believe that the structures of life are so complex and thus so improbable that they could never arise naturally. However, this is not a view shared by established science – here the arguments are seen as contrived.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Breakthrough for Intelligent Design?

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-breakthrough-for-intelligent-design&quot;&gt;A breakthrough for Intelligent Design?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer, professors of Informatics and Mathematical
Statistics, respectively, published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519320302071?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; titled “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning
of molecular machines and systems” in “Journal of Theoretical Biology” a regular scientific journal.
Within the Intelligent Design (ID) community the publication was seen as a breakthrough for ID as
science. A close reading of the paper, however, is not convincing. In seven blog posts on “Biolog(g)”
(a blog run by the staff at the Institute for biology and environmental science at the University of
Gothenburg, Sweden) I therefore have detailed my critique on four specific points, and also asked
how this paper could be published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-where-are-the-results&quot;&gt;1) Where are the results?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article title, “Using statistical methods to model …” as well as wordings in the article clearly state
that statistical methods have been used to demonstrate fine-tuning in the cell. However, no results
or calculations are presented to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-how-can-design-be-calculated&quot;&gt;2) How can design be calculated?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors present a statistical model comparing M1, a design model, and M2, a naturalistic model,
in their ability to explain the occurrence of complex cellular structures. However, M1 is
misconceived and M2 is unworkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-miracles-as-science&quot;&gt;3) Miracles as science?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also suggest that their statistical model can be used to study human evolution. Here,
they compare M1, a model assuming that humanity arose from a single human couple, and M2,
assuming common ancestry with chimpanzees. However, to explain how present human genetic
diversity could be generated from single couple within a time frame of 6000 to 10 000 years, they
resort to divine intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-non-physical-information&quot;&gt;4) Non-physical information?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their article, the authors introduce the revolutionary concept of “non-physical information”, but
without discussion or definition. The only reference goes to a text by philosopher Del Ratzsch, who
does not use the term. Instead, the authors have fabricated a hybrid sentence, part of it by Del
Ratzsch and part of it written by themselves, attributing it to Del Ratzsch. That is, they have
presented no evidence whatsoever for the existence of “non-physical information”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-why-is-id-not-regarded-as-science&quot;&gt;5) Why is ID not regarded as science?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reasons ID is not regarded as science are briefly outlined. It is pointed out that ID does not
formulate any concrete theories or predictions and consequently cannot be falsified. ID is a theory
without a theory, without method and without results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-why-was-this-article-written&quot;&gt;6) Why was this article written?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may ask why two established professors at respected Scandinavian universities would write an
article like this. The reason is conceivably that they both are connected to Discovery Institute, the
central hub of the ID movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-why-was-this-article-published&quot;&gt;7) Why was this article published?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article has been heavily criticized for being pseudoscientific, and the review procedures of the
Journal of Theoretical Biology have been questioned. After the first publication of this post in 2020
(in Swedish) additional information seems to confirm the suspicion that editors and reviewers were
pushing the article through the review process, against the policy of the journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;originally posted November 13, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Johan Erkell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That articles openly arguing for Intelligent Design (ID) are published in the established scientific press is not something one expects. Therefore, it is worth noting that Ola Hössjer, Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Stockholm University, and Steinar Thorvaldsen, professor of Information Science at Norway’s Arctic University in Tromsø, published a paper this summer entitled “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems” in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. On July 8, the Swedish Christian newspaper Världen Idag had a report about the publication under the heading “Breakthrough: Research points to intelligent design”. The Swedish creationist association Genesis writes that Norwegian-Swedish research points to intelligent design in our cells. Now is this a scientific breakthrough for ID?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not the breakthrough one had hoped for. When the article was printed in the September issue, there was a disclaimer from the magazine’s editors-in-chief on the website. They distance themselves from the concept of intelligent design and claim that they were misled by the fact that the authors did not include the keyword “intelligent design” during the review, but added it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much to say about this business, so much that I’m devoting seven posts to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of fine-tuning is one of the more common arguments for ID. It is argued that the natural constants that determine the properties of matter and the universe could have been radically different, and that the probability of a universe with properties that allow intelligent life is vanishingly small. Nevertheless, we are here, and that cannot be a coincidence. It shows design – a cosmic mind has created a universe that suits us. That’s the argument in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the work is to now go one step further and to show that fine-tuning also exists in the living cell and its components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper describes molecular fine-tuning, how it can be used in biology, and how it challenges conventional Darwinian thinking. We also discuss the statistical methods underpinning fine-tuning and present a framework for such analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning means that a number of natural constants have such values that life is possible. But the constants are still not so life-friendly that life could arise and develop through evolutionary processes. Life would therefore not be possible without the intervention of a designer. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer claim to see clear traces of design in the cell’s proteins and in its complex mechanisms. You get the image of a designer who doesn’t quite manage to create a sufficiently life-friendly universe, and is therefore forced to build all living beings together, in the smallest detail. The universe is both life-friendly and life-hostile at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, fine-tuning is a notoriously hard-to-define term, so one is glad to actually get a definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We define fine-tuning as an object with two properties: it must (a) be unlikely to have occurred by chance, under the relevant probability distribution (i.e., complex), and (b) conform to an independent or detached specification (i.e., specific).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first condition is therefore that it is unlikely that the object in question could have arisen by pure chance. The second is that it must respond to some sort of independent specification. The question is whether it is possible to detect fine-tuning with advanced statistical methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to recognize fine-tuning in biological systems at the levels of functional proteins, protein groups and cellular networks? Can fine-tuning in molecular biology be formulated using state of the art statistical methods, or are the arguments just “in the eyes of the beholder”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That complex biological structures cannot have been formed by pure chance is so obvious that one hardly needs advanced statistical methods to convince oneself of the matter. The real problem is the concept of “specification”; how to define specification in concrete terms is a question the ID movement has wrestled with for decades, without coming to any solution. The article’s discussion of the concept is purely mathematical, and contains no clues as to how specification could be demonstrated in practice. The authors refer to an article by George Montañez, “A unified model of complex specified information”, but this too is completely mathematical and says nothing about how one could determine whether a certain structure or molecule is specified or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the article, section 7, we read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional proteins, molecular machines and cellular networks are both unlikely when viewed as outcomes of a stochastic model, with a relevant probability distribution (having a small P(A)), and at the same time they conform to an independent or detached specification (the set A being defined in terms of specificity). These results are important and deduced from central phenomena of basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not possible to give an account of what specification actually means in practice. Instead, the authors refer to “central phenomena in basic science”, without giving any reference. In the last paragraph they write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A major conclusion of our work is that fine-tuning is a clear feature of biological systems. Indeed, fine-tuning is even more extreme in biological systems than in inorganic systems. It is detectable within the realm of scientific methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply not true. Since there is no working method to scientifically detect specificity in actual biological systems, it has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;  been possible to demonstrate fine-tuning with scientific methods. It has therefore &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been possible to conclude that fine-tuning is characteristic of biological systems. This is not possible because condition (b) of the definition of fine tuning is not met. It is also impossible for the simple reason that no actual data or any calculations are presented to support the claims. The statistical methods developed are not used to solve any actual problems. All you have is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the article reads “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems”. It applies that statistical methods have indeed been applied to model fine-tuning - the word “using” reasonably means that something has really been used. In fact, no methods have been applied at all; nothing has been discussed besides how it might be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to understand that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer in this way make it appear that they have results they clearly do not have. The reader may get the impression that they are bluffing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has Intelligent Design made a breakthrough as a science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction and background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I published the research article “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems” in the Journal of Theoretical Biology together with Steinar Thorvaldsen, who is Professor of Information Science at Tromsø University. In this paper, hereafter referred to as TH2020, we propose a mathematical and statistical framework to test whether biological systems (proteins, protein complexes, cellular networks) can arise by chance or whether fine-tuning is a better explanation. Fine-tuning of a system means that a number of different parameters must be finely calibrated for it to exist. This requires (a) that the probability of the system having arisen by chance is small, and (b) that there is an independent specification of what is fine-tuned. This specification could mean that the system must have all its parts in place in order to function, that it has arisen in a short time despite its complexity, or that it includes codes, instructions, and organized structures that we recognize from intelligent agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics, the concept of fine-tuning has been used for 50 years and today a majority of physicists claim that the universe must be fine-tuned in order to exist and harbor life. On the other hand, fine-tuning has not had the same impact on biology. One may ask why. One explanation is probably that in many examples fine-tuning is associated with an intelligent designer, which in turn brings God to mind. Although the definition of fine-tuning does not involve a designer, this is often the most reasonable interpretation or explanation of specification (b) above. This connection between fine-tuning and design has been central for Intelligent Design (ID), a movement that arose in the United States in the late 1980s with the aim of proposing explanations for the origin and diversity of life, that are alternatives to the secular theories (chemical and biological evolution) that dominate within the academic world. And as a Christian I go one step further and identify the Intelligent Designer with God. With a creationist perspective, I can then use the Bible as inspiration to propose and interpret specified properties of biological structures. Thus, while the ID movement goes “halfway” and identifies fine-tuning with a designer, creationists go “all the way” and interpret fine-tuning as something God created or brought about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my own part, I have both a creationist and an ID perspective. Depending on the research problem and context, I choose to go either half way or all the way in my interpretation of how the fine-tuning may have arisen, or to make no interpretation at all. Sometimes it is appropriate to leave it to the reader to consider how the fine-tuned structures arose, in other contexts it is important to justify that the proposed fine-tuning is inspired by the knowledge we have about intelligent senders, or by texts from the Bible. At the end of the aforementioned article, TH2020, Thorvaldsen and I go halfway and make a connection between fine-tuning and an intelligent source. As this is unusual within a secular academic environment, our publication has received a lot of attention and circulation. Last year, TH2020 was the most downloaded article in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those who got involved in the debate around TH2020 is Lars Johan Erkell, who is Associate Professor in Zoophysiology at the University of Gothenburg. On Biolog(g), a blog run by the teachers of the Department of Biology and Environmental Science at the University of Gothenburg, Erkell wrote a series of seven articles in November 2020, entitled “Breakthrough for Intelligent Design (?)”. In these articles he analyzes and comments on TH2020. As an academic, I welcome factual criticism where my research results are analyzed and seen at the seams. At best, such debates contribute to the advancement of science. I also want to thank Erkell for actually taking the time to read, not only TH2020, but also several of the articles that Steinar and I refer to. That makes parts of his criticism well-informed. At the same time, Erkell’s series of articles contains a series of claims, for instance that our article is not only pseudo-scientific but also anti-scientific. I therefore would like to take this opportunity to respond to this serious criticism. I have divided my response article into seven parts (corresponding to Erkell’s seven articles) and a concluding summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 1. The results of the fine-tuning article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction, the method for detecting fine-tuning in a biological system, which we propose in TH2020, involves two steps. First (a) to show that the probability is small that the system has arisen by chance and second (b) to demonstrate an external specification, which can be recognized by an observer. In part 1, Erkell asks what results are presented in TH2020. According to Erkell, our article contains only mathematical speculations that are not relevant to a biological reality. In other words, Erkell lacks concrete examples where we show how our mathematical theory for detecting fine-tuning should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that in TH2020 we do not have concrete examples with numerical calculations in order to illustrate our theory. But this is not the purpose of the article. Our aim is partly to provide an overview of fine-tuning and partly to propose a mathematical framework for establishing fine-tuning, which can then be used in subsequent articles to investigate whether a certain biological system (a protein, a protein complex, a cellular network) is fine-tuned or not. At the same time, TH2020 contains about a hundred references to other articles, and at several places we give concrete suggestions on how the specification in (b) should be chosen, as well as detailed justifications that the probability (a) that the biological system arose by chance is very small. In addition, several of the articles we refer to are based on empirical studies or analyses of such. In other words, our mathematical model is not plucked out of thin air.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is important to point out that mathematical models are simplifications of a more complicated biological reality. Whether the model is successful or not depends on how well it is able to describe empirical data. But this does not mean that every research article needs to contain such a connection between mathematics and empiricism, even if this connection is crucial in the long run. There are many examples of science (such as population genetics and theoretical ecology) which were indeed motivated by biological applications, but where initially the theory was developed quite separately from empirical work. Despite this, population genetics later became an important tool for describing small-scale microevolution, when more genetic data became available. Similarly, theoretical ecology has been used to understand the processes that bring about environmental and climate change. My question to Erkell is therefore whether he believes that such developments in the history of science lack value, where theoretical development sometimes precedes applications. Doesn’t this rather indicate a diversity of the scientific project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See for example Axe, D.D. (2004). Estimating the prevalence of protein sequences adopting functional enzyme folds. J. Mol. Biol. 341 (5), 1295–1315. and Kozulic, B., and Leisola, M. (2015). Have scientists already been able to surpass the capabilities of evolution? viXra Biochemistry 1504.0130.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Ola,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for commenting on my posts! There is a lot to discuss here, and I hope we can sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start with your question about whether I think it is OK to publish theoretical articles without empirical data. Yes, of course! It can lead to faster progress. Like when X-ray crystallographic diffraction patterns were first interpreted and the theory of space groups was already in place. So my criticism is not directed at you publishing a model without data, but that TH2020 clearly pretends to show  results, but does not contain any. How can you interpret “A major conclusion of our work is that fine-tuning is a clear feature of biological systems … It is detectable within the realm of scientific methodology” if not that you have concrete results showing that fine-tuning actually does exist in biological systems? I thought I expressed myself clearly here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the problems with the concept of “specification”. It’s notoriously difficult to define and I can’t find a clear definition or proper discussion of it in TH2020. But you suggest how it should be chosen, like “… a molecular machine, and that the specification states how many parts must be in place for x to work.” Another example is that f(x) indicates the biological fitness of an organism x, i.e. its reproductive capacity”. But one is a structure, the other is a property of a living organism. What does a definition look like that covers these very different cases? And what determines the necessary number of parts in a molecular machine? Furthermore, in the next example, if we move an organism from a favorable environment, where it has high biological fitness, to an unfavorable environment, where it has zero fitness, does it lose its specification? It is still the same organism. And is the specification a quality or a quantity? You mention both options in section 6.2. Which is it? You have to look for a more blurred concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this my first post, I had two points of criticism: (1) that you pretend to have results that do not exist, and (2) that you do not define or sufficiently discuss the term “specification”. In your answer you avoid both points. Do you have any comment on that?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lars Johan Erkell (with comments by Ola Hössjer)</name></author><summary type="html">The text is a pun in Swedish: &quot;Logg&quot; means something like a ship´s log or a logbook. A blog is &quot;blogg&quot;. So &quot;Biolog(g)&quot; is a biologist´s log or blog. &amp;nbsp; This exchange consists of seven posts, each with a comment by Ola Hössjer and a reply by Lars Johan Erkell, plus one other post by Erkell. It is a translation, mostly by Google Translate, from the original 2020 Swedish posts and comments. Erkell and Hössjer have kindly corrected the translation. You and they are welcome to comment at Panda’s Thumb. Keep in mind that the posts and these appended comments were written two years ago and thus cannot take more recent comments here into account. We hope to publish the sections on seven consecutive Wednesdays (we chose the day of the week without remembering its connection to ancient days in Sweden). Readers and these authors are invited to contribute further comments in our Disqus comment system. This week’s post starts with an introduction by Lars Johan Erkell, followed by the first of his posts at Biolog(g) and a comment by Ola Hössjer followed by a rejoinder by Lars Erkell. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Introduction by Lars Johan Erkell A breakthrough for Intelligent Design? Two years ago, Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer, professors of Informatics and Mathematical Statistics, respectively, published an article titled “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems” in “Journal of Theoretical Biology” a regular scientific journal. Within the Intelligent Design (ID) community the publication was seen as a breakthrough for ID as science. A close reading of the paper, however, is not convincing. In seven blog posts on “Biolog(g)” (a blog run by the staff at the Institute for biology and environmental science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden) I therefore have detailed my critique on four specific points, and also asked how this paper could be published.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This morning's eclipse of the moon</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/this-mornings-eclipse.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This morning's eclipse of the moon" /><published>2022-11-08T10:25:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-11-08T10:25:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/this-mornings-eclipse</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/11/this-mornings-eclipse.html">&lt;figure&gt;
