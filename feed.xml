&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Lovell, an outstanding defender of evolution and promoter of public understanding of science, died on January 26, 2023, from injuries suffered in a fall. He was 79 years old. He is survived by his wife Debbie and children Annie Lovell, Frank Lovell III, Alicia Lovell (Dennis Nalley) and Simon Lovell (Sneha Thapa) (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Ashland Kentucky, he served four years in the United States Army. He then studied physical organic chemistry at the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky, receiving a bachelor’s degree from the latter. A 30-year career with General Electric in Louisville followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank’s anti-creationism efforts began in 1982 with letters to the editor; he estimated that he wrote a couple of dozen letters in the next couple of years (2). In 1983, I had a letter of my own published, critiquing a creationist op-ed. A couple of days later, I received a letter from Frank, praising my letter and including a copy of the letter he had written personally to the creationist. He invited me to join him in fighting creationism. This was the beginning of an extensive collaboration that would continue until I moved away from Louisville in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank and I decided to form a new Committee of Correspondence in the Louisville area, the Kentucky Committee for Science Education. This was to complement the existing Committee for Effective Action in Science Education (CEASE) in Lexington, founded by Drs. Eugenie Scott and Wayne Davis of the University of Kentucky. Unlike the case in Lexington, where proposed teaching of creationism in public schools led to the formation of CEASE, there did not appear to be a similar threat in Louisville. Rather, our focus was on the public presentations (letters to the editor, public talks, media presentations, etc.) of local creationists, particularly ministers of the Church of Christ. (Frank designed a letterhead with a KCSE logo, and issued documents on behalf of the group, but in reality it just consisted of the two of us.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-right-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/Wheeler_Fig_2_FrankPoster_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Frank at a poster session&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Poster session, 1986.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank described our efforts in a presentation at a 1988 AAAS meeting, which can be seen in a YouTube video (2). These included letters to the editor; correspondence with local creationist speakers and other individuals; a poster presentation; handouts distributed at talks related to evolution; and public talks of our own. We engaged extensively with one biology-trained preacher, and even got invited to give a couple of talks at his church. Throughout this we tried to document errors in materials of prominent young-Earth creationists, and hold the locals accountable for not repeating arguments that had been shown to be false. The bulk of this correspondence was Frank’s work; his scholarly output was impressive, especially in light of all his other interests (as noted below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, the local pastors challenged us to a public debate. I decided that, given the pitfalls of debating creationists and the amount of time required to debate properly, it was not something I wanted to do. However, Frank accepted the challenge, and a four-night debate was arranged (3). I assisted Frank. The creationists brought in Dr. H.E. “Buddy” Payne from Florida College. Frank made a vigorous attack on the young Earth model as promoted by the Institute for Creation Research. However, Payne refused to take a stand on the age of the Earth, leaving him free to attack standard findings from geology and evolution without having to defend anything. As I noted (3), “Overall, Payne’s superior public speaking ability probably helped make his presentation more persuasive to the audience, which appeared to be mostly sympathetic to creationism.” Frank acknowledged that it was “a very humbling, character building experience” (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also corresponded with both nationally known creationists and scientific experts in analyzing and responding to creationist claims. These included meteoritic dust on the moon (4) and Grand Canyon lava flows. Frank also assisted me in my detailed rebuttal to D. James Kennedy’s presentations on “The John Ankerberg Show.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of Frank’s activities was attending creationist conferences, often with Robert Schadewald. They frequently met informally with creationists at lunch. As Schadewald wrote (5), “…our interactions with the creationists invariably were cordial or better…We both felt that these exchanges were the best part of the conference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have less information about Frank’s activities after I left Louisville in 2006, but I believe that he continued to defend evolution with similar enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was also active in combating other forms of pseudoscience besides creationism. When the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) issued a call for local groups to coordinate with its goals, we volunteered KCSE to be such a group. Simultaneous, Dr. Robert A. Baker of the University of Kentucky offered to form a group. We decided to defer to Dr. Baker’s leadership and joined his new Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics (KASES). Later, Frank accepted my invitation to join the Kentucky Council Against Health Fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank’s activities were not restricted to critiquing bad science; he was an active promoter of scientific knowledge and science education. He was a long-time member of the Louisville Astronomical Society, serving at various times as President, Chairman of the Board, Editor, and Librarian. He served nearly 30 years as a member of the Board of Directors of the Louisville Regional Science Fair, and at different times was Head Judge for physics, Head Judge for team projects, Judging Committee Coordinator, and Fair Co-director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major interest of Frank’s was philosophy and religion. I recall that he described himself as “an atheist of the agnostic variety,” meaning he could not disprove the existence of God, but found no compelling reason to believe. He was an active member of the Louisville Freethought Society, participating in weekly meetups and staffing a booth at the Kentucky State Fair each year. As he did with creationists, he carried on extensive correspondence with preachers and lay individuals concerning religious topics, and gave public talks. One of these that I attended was a two-night debate with a local minister. He expressed his views on science and religion as follows: “Where ever objective knowledge is incomplete, there is a place for religious ‘faith’ (for any who feel need for religious ‘faith,’ at any rate); but where ever objective knowledge and religious ‘faith’ conflict, it is religious ‘faith’ (not objective knowledge) which should be modified or abandoned. That is the only rational way that there can be no conflict between science and religion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a regular participant on FreeThought Channel, including a major interview (6). His fellow panelists have posted a remembrance (7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank had a large following on Facebook, where he regularly posted on new scientific developments, philosophical questions, and videos of musical performances that he felt especially enjoyable. The announcement of his death on his Facebook page was met with an outpouring of condolences from around the world. Here is one typical comment: “I deeply appreciated his intelligence, integrity, humanity, warmth and tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas J. Wheeler was a biochemistry professor at the University of Louisville for 25 years, followed by a second career as a high school science teacher in Scranton, PA. He is now retired and living in the Chicago area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funder of the “He Gets Us” ad broadcast during the Super Bowl also funds many groups including Answers in Genesis and the Discovery Institute via dark money techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several investigators have recently looked into The Servant Foundation because they funded the “He Gets Us” Super Bowl advertisements for Jesus (for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.au.org/the-latest/articles/christian-nationalist-donors-super-bowl-jesus-ad/&quot;&gt;Americans United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://skepchick.org/2023/02/whos-behind-those-jesus-ads-youre-gonna-see-during-the-big-game/&quot;&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/a&gt;, aka Skepchick). Both AU and Skepchick discovered that, in spite of the liberal-sounding nature of the Super Bowl advertising, the Servant Foundation also has donated to numerous fundamentalist Christian Nationalist hate groups. Apparently, the Servant Foundation is a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds&quot;&gt;donor-advised fund&lt;/a&gt;” and receives donations for a number of worthy causes as well as cringeworthy hateful groups. Because of loopholes in the tax laws, people can donate to the Servant Foundation and see that their money goes to their favorite extremist groups via a “donor-advised fund” without their identity being revealed; this is basically “dark-money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, The Servant Foundation, doing business as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesignatry.com/&quot;&gt;The Signatry&lt;/a&gt;,” presently has assets approaching $1 billion. I looked at their publicly available IRS Form 990’s for 2016 to 2020 and, besides a handful of small donations to worthy organizations, and many organizations of whom I am unaware, there were a number of donations to far-right, generally Christian Nationalist, organizations. I have mentioned below a number of them that are listed in the Form 990 from 4/1/20 to 3/31/21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Answers in Genesis and the Discovery Institute have received monies from The Servant Foundation, presumably via a “donor-advised fund.” Since 2016, Answers in Genesis has received $19,349,691.00, and the Discovery Institute, $750,600.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although AIG seems to have difficulty with the shrinking number of paid tickets at the Ark Encounter, they will never go broke because of donations, including these by The Servant Foundation’s donor-advised fund. So who is supplying this dark money to the creationists? Without donor transparency, this question may be impossible to answer. Kentucky media are shrinking and only rarely cover AIG and the Ark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting information below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Servant Foundation’s IRS Form 990’s are available via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instrumentl.com/990-report/servant-foundation&quot;&gt; this website &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other groups that interested me and are listed as receiving donations (this is a far from a comprehensive list) include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academy for Climate and Energy Analysis, Inc. Shawnee, Kansas, $5,500.00 (a tiny group run by a former TV weatherman that promotes anti-climate change disinformation. Seems mostly to be repeating Heartland Institute disinformation. https://aceanalysis.org/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alliance Defending Freedom, $16,657,150.00 (far right fundamentalist organization in spite of the Orwellian name, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_defending_freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Family Association, $8,550.00 (a huge fundamentalist Christian Nationalist organization, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Associatio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creation Instruction Association, Inc., Juanita, Nebraska, $5,500.00 (a creationist organization that has a “Seismosaurus Mobile Museum” in an 18 wheeler truck. Lots of dinosaurs with humans dioramas, and also some real and replica fossils, https://www.creationinstruction.org/). A minor player, but still…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovery Institute, $250,500.00 (the leading “intelligent design” creationist organization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute. Yep, they are still out there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edchoice Kentucky, Inc., Frankfort KY, $10,000.00 (a small organization here in Kentucky that advocates governmental support for charter and “non-public ” schools, https://edchoiceky.com/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s Not Dead Foundation doing business as Pure Flix, $15,000.00 (Pure Flix is partnered with Answers in Genesis so you can watch Ken Ham videos to your heart’s content if you join).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institute for Creation Research, Dallas, TX, $11,000.00 (the granddaddy of creationist “science” organizations. Relatively tiny now that AiG is the biggest creationist ministry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan B. Peterson Institute, Witchita, Kansas, $12,500.00 (Peterson has an inexplicable right wing young male anti-feminist following as a psychologist and amateur philosopher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prager University Foundation, Owings Mills, Maryland, $220,750.00 (a “university.” Note that I use scare-quotes here, as actual universities are not based on a large collection of YouTube videos, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PragerU).&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, the Library of Congress asks (and answers), How can you tell the difference between a butterfly and a moth? which notes several distinguishing features, not just one.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creationism crawls back out of the woodwork</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/02/creationism-crawls-back.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creationism crawls back out of the woodwork" /><published>2023-02-10T09:22:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-10T09:22:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/02/creationism-crawls-back</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/02/creationism-crawls-back.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently learned of an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edhat.com/news/why-creationism-may-come-back-to-our-schools&quot;&gt;Why Creationism May Come Back to Our Schools&lt;/a&gt;, by Eugenie Scott, the former director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/&quot;&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;. The occasion was a talk presented by Dr. Scott to the Humanist Society of Santa Barbara on February 1 and ably reported by Robert Bernstein for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edhat.com/&quot;&gt;Edhat&lt;/a&gt;, an online newspaper that covers Santa Barbara County, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may read Mr. Bernstein’s article for yourself; let it suffice to say that Dr. Scott reviews “many decades of cases” regarding the Establishment Clause and discusses why creationism generally fails. Then, she says, we come to the Kennedy case, wherein the Supreme Court overruled lower-court decisions and ruled that an assistant football coach, Joseph Kennedy, will be allowed to pray at the center of the football field with his students. The decision is troubling because the new right-wing Supreme Court has no trouble overruling previously established decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jerry Coyne tells us, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/02/09/montana-considers-bill-that-allows-teaching-of-scientific-fcts-but-not-scientific-theories/&quot;&gt;Montana considers a bill that allows teaching of “scientific facts” but not “scientific theories”&lt;/a&gt;. Prof. Coyne is the proprietor of the popular blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com &quot;&gt;Why Evolution Is True&lt;/a&gt; and, as they say, has read the bill so you and I do not have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill in question is Montana Senate Bill 235, introduced by freshman Senator Dan Emrich. Prof. Coyne quotes the bill as saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, [sic] the purpose of K-12 education is to educate children in the facts of our world to better prepare them for their future and further education in their chosen field of study, and to that end children must know the difference between scientific fact and scientific theory; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, [sic] a scientific fact is observable and repeatable, and if it does not meet these criteria, it is a theory that is defined as speculation and is for higher education to explore, debate, and test to ultimately reach a scientific conclusion of fact or fiction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Coyne adds, ‘They later clarify: “As used in this section, ‘scientific fact’ means an indisputable and repeatable observation of a natural phenomenon.”’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very little in science can be considered an indisputable fact, so if this bill passes and becomes law, schools will not be allowed to teach, say, the theory of relativity, quantum theory, ideal gas theory, the germ theory of disease, or, for that matter, string theory or the theory of the leisure class. Or, what they are really after, the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Sen. Emrich and his cosponsors are a trio of ignoramuses who do not have the foggiest idea what a scientific fact or a scientific theory is. They are very dangerous because, as Dr. Scott shows, they almost certainly have the Supreme Court on their side.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Creationist car spotted on Broad Street in Athens, Georgia.

&lt;figcaption&gt; Actual Ark attendance vs. projected, based on the data of William Trollinger. The actual attendance in Year 1 seems to be an estimate. Actual attendance for the period March 2020 through February 2021 have been omitted owing to Covid. Actual attendance for the period January through June 2023 is an estimate based on the historical ratio of attendance during the first six months of the year to that of the last six months.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Trollinger, on the blog Righting America, presents what he calls a few facts about Ark Encounter attendance and deems that attendance to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://rightingamerica.net/not-even-close-to-what-was-projected-a-few-facts-about-ark-encounter-attendance/&quot;&gt;Not Even Close to What Was Projected&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Trollinger bases his conclusion on data acquired by the indomitable Dan Phelps, an occasional guest contributor here at PT. Mr. Phelps each month uses the Kentucky Open Records Act to ascertain the monies collected by the city of Williamstown from the safety fee of $0.50 added to each ticket. From these data it is easy to deduce the number of tickets sold and therefore the number of patrons in any given month, apart from a number of possibly fictitious season-pass holders who pass the ticket window without being assessed the safety fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have graphed Dr. Trollinger’s data and show them as the frontispiece to this article. Two of the years, as noted, are estimates. Year 4 is actually a two-year period from July 2019 to June 2021, but with March 2020 through February 2021 omitted because of the Covid pandemic. The result does not seem out of line. Overall attendance, over the 6 years, is about 40 % of projected attendance and appears to have fallen somewhat since Year 3, as projected attendance rises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, as Dr. Trollinger notes, Williamstown issued $62 million in junk bonds and in effect forwent a significant sum in property taxes.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to the titular question depends on what you think they are designed for; hence, it seems to be a silly question. When it comes to the eyes, however, there is little doubt: human (and other vertebrate) retinas are in backward in that nerves, blood vessels, and other structures are piled on top of the photoreceptors and thus reduce sensitivity, if not resolution. Additionally, the nerves go out through a hole in the retina, which makes us susceptible to glaucoma. Cephalopod retinas, by contrast, face forward, with nothing covering the photoreceptors, and the nerves do not have to pass through a hole in the retina. Cephalopod eyes are thus clearly better designed than human eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raise this question by way of introducing an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://skepticalinquirer.org/2022/12/the-night-begins-to-shine-the-tapetum-lucidum-and-our-backward-retinas/&quot;&gt;The night begins to shine: The tapetum lucidum and our backward retinas&lt;/a&gt;, by Nathan H. Lents, in the January-February issue of &lt;i&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;. The tapetum lucidum, or just tapetum, is a reflective membrane in the retinas of many nocturnal vertebrates and is located just behind the photoreceptors. Its purpose is presumedly to direct the light that the photoreceptors miss back into them and thereby increase the sensitivity. Interestingly, tapetums composed of many different materials appear to have evolved many different times in different creatures. Cephalopods have no tapetum, presumably because their retinas face forward, with the photoreceptors directly facing the light. Prof. Lents explains all this and more in great but easily understandable detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please forgive a physicist’s digression. I once lost a debate as to whether the retina is in backward or not. It is in backward. (In most anatomical drawings, however, the cones appear at least vaguely conical, with the open end facing the incoming light. Thus, the cones themselves are not exactly in backward.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, we are presumably dealing with rod (scotopic) vision, and the rods supposedly trap light due to total internal reflection. If that is so, then the law of refraction prohibits light traveling in the opposite direction (toward the light source) from getting into the rod. How then is the tapetum helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot immediately find an answer to this question, so I will stick my neck out and suggest that the evanescent wave penetrates the rod and is absorbed by the dyes in the rod, similarly to frustrated total internal reflection. If that is so, then it is hard to see how the tapetum can be very effective, but I guess every little bit counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;, January 28, 2023, 3:30 p.m., MST. A version of this post appeared in the Lexington (Kentucky) Herald-Leader under the head &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article271570602.html&quot;&gt;Creation Museum to host anti-abortion event with extremist pastor, Ky legislators | Opinion&lt;/a&gt;.

You may see the text of his letter in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/01/ken-ham-using.html#comment-6101095162&quot;&gt;Comment 6101095162&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Phelps replies there that Mr. Looy’s reply “seems to concede what I said, but tries to obfuscate. He admits that the legislation would cause women that have abortions be charged with murder and that Pastor Jeff Durbin advocates the death penalty.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis (AiG), along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://metro.co.uk/2017/02/27/hipster-says-he-wants-to-execute-women-who-have-abortions-6475717/&quot;&gt;the extremist Jeff Durbin&lt;/a&gt; of Arizona’s Apologia Church, are hosting a political event for pastors at the Creation Museum to support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lyiv2zQr6k&quot;&gt;pending Kentucky anti-abortion legislation&lt;/a&gt;.  To my knowledge &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/23rs/index_headings.html&quot;&gt;this legislation has not yet been introduced&lt;/a&gt; as of January 18. The rally is also advertised on January 18, AiG’s weekly “Answers News”, near the end of the show (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AUkCdwY6LVs&quot;&gt;about 34 minutes in&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in March 2007, when the Creation Museum was about to open, AiG’s Mark Looy and Ken Ham penned a post to their website titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/world-religions/humanism/goose-stepping-to-zion/&quot;&gt;Goose-stepping to Zion&lt;/a&gt;.”    This essay claims AiG is “apolitical” and states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Hedges insinuates that the creation movement (especially AiG, for he spends most of his chapter on us) is a major part of America’s religious right and its fascist tendencies, AiG is apolitical. It avoids the political arena. It’s not our job to change the culture—it’s our job to disseminate information, proclaim the gospel, and stand on the authority of God’s Word … and THEN see hearts changed for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Now, if these changed lives impact the culture, and if God blesses that, then we’re happy to see it. But we’re not going to be an activist ministry in the sense of legislating, litigating or lobbying key leaders to mandate change in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, policy on politicking has changed for AiG since 2007. Last October AiG had an “Answers for Pastors” meeting at the Ark Encounter featuring White Christian Nationalist Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. I reported on this on the Panda’s Thumb &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/09/extreme-right-wing-Christian-nationalist.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this upcoming political rally for pastors supporting specific legislation is particularly disturbing, and not because it is about abortion. This event indicates Ham/AiG are becoming more overtly involved in Kentucky politics. Will Kentuckians see AiG become more involved in a multitude of political issues? Will AiG begin to endorse political candidates? AiG’s 501(c)(3) religious non-profit status may preclude such activities, but the IRS has generally been lax in its enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see which state legislators, candidates for governor, and other politicians attend the Creation Museum rally. The separation of church and state in Kentucky looks weak at this writing. Meanwhile, AiG’s influence in Kentucky, political and otherwise, continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Phelps</name></author><summary type="html">Update, January 28, 2023, 3:30 p.m., MST.

&lt;p&gt;A new article has been published in the illustrious journal &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Burgess, S. (2022). &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.3&quot;&gt;Why the Ankle-Foot Complex Is a Masterpiece of Engineering and a Rebuttal of “Bad Design” Arguments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt;, 2022.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with it, &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] is a journal dedicated to publishing work from the Intelligent Design creationist community. Frustrated by their almost completely futile efforts to get their work or ideas published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, intelligent design proponents took to creating their own journal in 2010 with Douglas Axe as the founding editor-in-chief. Axe was also head of the Biologic Institute, the only research institute dedicated to intelligent design creationism, and the publisher of &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]. The institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/biologic-institute-closes.html&quot;&gt;has now closed&lt;/a&gt;. No word yet on what will happen with the journal, but I imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/inteliigent-design-think-tanks-institute-is-a-shutterstock-image/&quot;&gt;the green screen&lt;/a&gt; has been repurposed. You can read more about the history of the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/latest-intelligent-design-journal&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] and The Biologic Institute (and Axe himself to a certain extent), are all funded by the Discovery Institute, the organizing body of the intelligent design creationist movement, which probably needs no introduction to the readers of Panda’s Thumb. But in case you’ve just crawled out of the Olduvai Gorge, you can read about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new article on the human ankle by Stuart Burgess perfectly aligns with the grand traditions of &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is just the third and final article published in in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/issue/view/36&quot;&gt;in all of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Their original ambitious goal was one article per month (lol), but they have yet to exceed four articles in any calendar year. In 2017, they published just one manuscript in the &quot;research article&quot; category and one &quot;critical review.&quot; This year, the three published articles are in the &quot;critical focus&quot; category, meaning they did not publish a single “research article” in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The article above was written by someone who is also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/about/editorialTeam&quot;&gt;the editorial board&lt;/a&gt; of the journal. In fact, nearly all of the contributing authors in the history of the journal are also editors and most are also Discovery Institute fellows or contributors. In 2010-2011, the journal published a total of seven articles across all article types, four of them co-authored by editor-in-chief Douglas Axe. Of course, it is not unheard of that a journal &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; publishes original work by someone on the editorial board, but this practice is usually kept to a minimum for obvious reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2022 was exceptional, however, because the three articles published in &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] are all by different authors! In most years, to reach the impressive feat of 3 or 4 articles, they publish multiple articles from the same author or team of authors, essentially by cutting articles into pieces. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/issue/view/35&quot;&gt;the entire published work of the journal in 2021&lt;/a&gt; is three articles, all by the same author, with titles ending in &quot;part 1,&quot; &quot;part 2,&quot; and &quot;part 3.&quot; In the year before that, two of the four published articles were by the same trio of authors and cover the same topic. The exact same was true for 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The reason the article above caught my attention is that it is written as a rebuttal to a few paragraphs in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/book-human-errors/&quot;&gt;2018 popular science book &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I am mentioned by name 19 times (20 if you count the reference list), including in the abstract and in one of the section headings. I am most flattered by this continued attention, but it is not exactly in keeping with the standards and customs of academic science. Scientific data and ideas generally stand on their own and are offered on their own terms. While debates and rebuttals are also part of science, and I have been involved in some of those as well, they are never structured as a debate between persons, especially in the published literature. This article reads more like a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.3&quot;&gt;article itself&lt;/a&gt; is simply a summary of the structure and function of the human ankle, which can be summed up by saying the ankle is incredibly complex and good at what it does (notwithstanding the strains and sprains we all get). Somehow, this is offered as evidence against evolution and for intelligent design. Please feel free to read the article itself and comment below if you find any evidence against the notion that the human ankle is the product of standard evolutionary forces. I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, in the words of fellow Panda’s Thumb contributor Anj Petto, an expert in functional morphology, “There is not a single aspect of the ankle that I can think of that exists in anticipation of the needs for the particular combination of stability, strength, and flexibility that bipedal striding requires. All of the pieces exist in the generalized primate foot, and there is a series of changes in the foot among the hominins (certainly from &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; forward) that show transitional features that reduce the muscle activity required to walking on 2 legs so that in the modern human ankle (foot, knee, hips, and lower back, as well) the skeletal system (bones, joints, cartilage, and ligaments) are supporting the upright posture so that the muscles are mostly used for propulsion rather than for supporting the upright posture.” This latter item is among the points I was making in &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Burgess does a fine job explaining the structure and function of the human ankle, but for some reason takes its functioning as evidence that it was intentionally designed and not evolved. The human body is truly impressive, a point I repeatedly made in &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;, but it also harbors abundant evidence of its long evolutionary past including, in my opinion, some examples of suboptimal functional design that are only comprehensible in the light of the limitations of evolutionary processes and our shared ancestry with other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have no idea why they chose to hyphenate (and weirdly capitalize) &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] when the perfectly serviceable word &lt;i&gt;Biocomplexity&lt;/i&gt; already exists, sans hyphen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
