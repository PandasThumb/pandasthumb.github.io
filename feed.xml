&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago, in an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/10/do-we-have-free-will.html&quot;&gt;Do we have free will? No&lt;/a&gt;, I threatened to read Robert Sapolsky’s splendid book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Determined-Science-Life-without-Free-ebook/dp/B0BSKQ5ZDM/&quot;&gt;Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I read it, and we still do not have free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in my earlier article, I had myself argued that we lack free will in my book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe&lt;/a&gt;. My argument was kind of bare-bones, basically that we are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry, which are deterministic (except perhaps for the occasional quantum fluctuation), so our actions must also be deterministic. Though my wording was not the best, I also argued that criminals should therefore be rehabilitated or quarantined and not punished. Sapolsky fleshes all this out in great (if not excruciating) detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky thinks that it sounds “nuts” to claim that we have no free will. Not to me: it seems to me that the claim follows from first principles. But Sapolsky devotes several chapters to describing how neurons work, how they cause us to “pull the trigger,” and, more importantly, how they make us decide whether or not to pull the trigger. Early on he remarks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Show me a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior is independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you have demonstrated free will. The point of the first half of this book is to establish that this cannot be shown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sapolsky says “free will,” he does not mean that your decision was not coerced; rather he means that, given free rein, &lt;i&gt;you could have made no other decision than the one you did&lt;/i&gt;. For Sapolsky, the neuron that told you to tighten your muscle and pull some hypothetical trigger was influenced by another neuron that was itself chosen by one part of the brain telling it, “Go!” and another part of the brain telling it, “Whoa, slow down!” Which of those parts of the brain won out depended upon your own history, which itself depended on your prenatal environment, your environment growing up, your culture, and who knows what else? Where in this chain of events, asks Sapolsky, did something intervene between one neuron and the next, and tell you whether to pull the trigger or not? There is no room for such an intervention, though some &lt;i&gt;compatiblists&lt;/i&gt; – those who agree that our brains are purely deterministic but that we have free will anyway – will argue otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In successive sections called “Seconds to minutes before [you pull the trigger],” “Minutes to days before,” “Weeks to years before,” and then “Back to adolescence,” “And childhood,” and so on, Sapolsky details how your history and even your culture’s history determine your actions and decisions. Ever steal something? Maybe not, if you were brought up wealthy. But what if you were brought up poor and had to steal a loaf of bread to survive? In the first case, assuming that you were tempted, the Whoa! part of your brain won out, whereas in the second case the Go! part of your brain won out. In each case, your response was purely biochemical, I am afraid, and the wealthy person who does not steal has nothing in particular to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sapolsky, it is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down&quot;&gt;turtles all the way down&lt;/a&gt; but rather neurons all the way to the beginning, or at least, I suppose, to the evolution of the neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go into a lot more detail would require a booklet, at least. But let me note, for example, that being exposed to a disgusting smell can change your attitudes toward what Sapolsky calls “purity violations.” How can that be? Evidently the processing of stimuli that we consider &lt;i&gt;morally&lt;/i&gt; disgusting has co-opted part of the older brain region for processing &lt;i&gt;physically&lt;/i&gt; disgusting things such as spoiled or rotting food, and there is crosstalk. Experimental subjects will not tell you, “Oh, that disgusting smell influenced my decision to punish that person”; rather, they will tell you that some “recent insight” influenced their decision. Now statistically changing people’s attitudes by exposing them to disgusting smells does not disprove free will, but it goes part way toward making the case, and of course Sapolsky goes into much greater depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky treats us to chapters on chaos, emergence, and quantum mechanics. As briefly as possible, he notes that chaos is actually &lt;i&gt;deterministic&lt;/i&gt; (except possibly for the occasional quantum fluctuation), but not &lt;i&gt;calculable&lt;/i&gt; because we cannot calculate with sufficient precision. He takes to task several thinkers who have tied free will to chaos because they frankly do not understand the difference between being deterministic and being calculable – the weather, for example, is deterministic, but we cannot calculate it beyond a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergent properties are properties which arise in complex systems made up of simple elements, when those simple elements combine in such a way as to create new properties that are not displayed in the simple elements themselves. One water molecule is not wet, but a sufficiently large collection of water molecules displays the property of wetness, and wetness is known as an emergent property. Another example, which Sapolsky particularly likes: certain kinds of ants (which have not the slightest understanding of bridge building and certainly no blueprints) use their bodies to build a bridge in order to span a gap in their path. That bridge is emergent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that free will may be an emergent property of a collection of neurons, then you need to show how free will may emerge. One way you may do so, incorrectly, is by misunderstanding the distinction between deterministic and calculable; see above. Or you may assume, as Sapolsky puts it, that once you have emergent states, they can “do whatever the hell they want.” And finally, you may think that, again in Sapolsky’s words, “… an emergent state can reach down and change the fundamental nature of the [building blocks] comprising it.” It is like saying that, once they have built the bridge, those ants no longer have to behave like ants. If you want more, get the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky says he really did not want to write chapters on quantum indeterminacy. Not only does he not understand quantum indeterminacy; neither does anyone else. His description of the double-slit experiment is pretty good, except where he repeats a very common misconception: when you block one of the slits or attempt to measure which slit the electron passed through, it does not stop behaving like a wave. The double-slit pattern disappears, but we still see the diffraction pattern of a single slit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not – cannot – go into much detail here, but I am firmly in agreement with Sapolsky when he says that if quantum indeterminacy were an important factor in governing our behavior, we would make decisions randomly, and that is not exactly my definition of free will. Mostly, we do not make decisions randomly, so the effect of quantum indeterminacy must obviously be small. Sapolsky explains why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book concerns crime and punishment or, perhaps more accurately, transgression and rehabilitation. Sapolsky asks the question, if everyone believed we had no free will, would we all run amok? I do not know the answer to that question, but I can reasonably assure you that neither Sapolsky nor I have ever run amok, and I daresay that we do not intend to. That said, Sapolsky cites some studies that show that you can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; undermine someone's belief in free will and they feel less of a sense of agency…. And most important for our purposes, they become less ethical in their behavior, less helpful, and more aggressive. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky wittily advises us to “burn this book before anyone else stumbles upon it and has their moral compass on board.” Fortunately, the effect was small, and a meta-analysis showed no consistent effects. Sapolsky searches for evidence that religious people are nicer than atheists and comes up with a statistic that religious people are, for example, more charitable than atheists. I think that statistic is fairly well known, but Sapolsky notes that their charity extends largely to their own group; in other words, they are largely charitable toward themselves. (Indeed, I have looked at my own charitable contributions and find that about 30 % go to my synagogue, though some of that is only temporary. Other monies, which I have not quantified, go to local agencies from which I may benefit. Charity may begin at home, but sometimes it also ends at home.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky pretty well establishes that atheists and those who do not believe in free will are no better or worse than religious people and those who believe in free will. That leaves the question, though, what do free-will deniers recommend that we do with transgressors, if we believe that they do not control their own actions? Punishment seems inappropriate, but they can inflict very real loss or pain. Sapolsky provides a long history showing in detail how much we have improved since the days when we used to draw and quarter people. Also, we have improved since the days when we thought, for example, that schizophrenia was a result of poor mothering, rather than the brain disease we now know it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then to do with transgressors? Quarantine them, the way we quarantine people with various diseases (or should I say non-mental diseases?). When he says quarantine, however, he does not mean jail in the way the US as a practical matter applies the term. To the contrary, he says we must quarantine people in a way that constrains them the least, because in the last analysis their transgressions are not their fault. He points to Norway, where prisoners live in tiny apartments with televisions and various amenities, and yet the recidivism rate is one-quarter that of the US, where people can actually learn to be better criminals in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the book is 400 pages long, not counting notes. I thought it could have been a lot shorter. For example, the author spends a great deal of time on schizophrenia (not to mention drawing and quartering). In the middle of the last century, in the complete absence of evidence and sometimes in defiance of evidence, psychoanalysts blamed schizophrenia on mothers’ parenting. Even when schizophrenia was conclusively demonstrated to be a brain disease and treatable with drugs, psychoanalysts refused to give in. Sapolsky seems angry and heaps a great deal of well-deserved opprobrium – but according to his belief and mine, these mid-century psychoanalysts had no choice but to believe what they believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewer’s last inch. I want to renew my complaint that the Kindle edition, which I may lease but not purchase, at $16.99 costs the same as the paperback and $4.15 less than the hardcover, both of which I may own and do whatever I want with. I read the Kindle edition, and I was less than satisfied with the figures. The book was long and there were many, many endnotes; I sometimes had the impression that the author had unearthed all this material and was, by God, going to get it in one way or another. Even on a Kindle the notes were annoying, and I skipped most of them; I imagine they would have become intolerable if you tried to read them all in the print edition. Finally, though I very much appreciated the informal style and occasional humor, and noticed very few spelling or other errors, I thought the editor should have cut out the more extreme cuss words.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Several weeks ago, in an article entitled Do we have free will?

As the title suggests, I analyze all of the major mathematical arguments put forth by creationists and intelligent design (ID) proponents and find them all to be very poor.  Inevitably, I devote a fair amount of space to William Dembski’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I naturally raised an eyebrow upon hearing that Dembski has now released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Design-Inference-Eliminating-through-Probabilities/dp/1637120346&quot;&gt; revised and expanded edition&lt;/a&gt; of his 1998 book &lt;i&gt;The Design Inference&lt;/i&gt;, now coauthored with Winston Ewert.  I wondered if he would have anything worthwhile to say in response to my book, and it was gratifying to see that my name shows up numerous times in the index.  I will look forward to seeing what he has to say, once I have acquired a copy of the book.  However, Dembski has &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2023/11/an-argument-from-ignorance/&quot;&gt;posted an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from the book’s Introduction, and I was delighted to see that, perhaps inadvertently, he has simply conceded two of the main points I raised against his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that Dembski’s catchphrase is “complex, specified information.”  Roughly, this means that if something has a low probability of arising by chance and instantiates an independently describable pattern, then intelligent design is implicated at some point in its causal history.  In my book, I argued that, to the extent that he intends to apply this to biological structures, he has no hope of establishing either complexity or specificity.  We have nothing like the information we need to carry out a meaningful probability calculation, and we have no background information relevant to distinguishing design-suggesting patterns from those we simply impose on nature (like seeing a dragon in a fluffy, cumulus cloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I noted that when Dembski calculates the probability of something like a flagellum, he explicitly assumes that an “irreducibly complex” (IC) system cannot evolve by gradual means.  This means his argument is completely parasitic on Michael Behe’s claims about IC systems: If those claims are correct, then they are all by themselves a strong argument against evolution.  A probability calculation adds nothing.  But since those claims are completely wrong, no calculation based on them will have any meaning.  For specification, I noted that Dembski presents an elaborate mathematical apparatus, complete with notation, jargon, and Greek letters, which is meant to allow us to distinguish real patterns from artificial ones.  But then he never uses that machinery for anything, but instead just says that biological structures are obviously specified by their function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that set-up, here is Dembski from his Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tacitly in the first edition of &lt;i&gt;The Design Inference&lt;/i&gt; and explicitly in its sequel, &lt;i&gt;No Free Lunch&lt;/i&gt;, I argued that natural selection and random variation could not create the sort of complexity we see in living things.  My approach in applying the design inference to biology was to piggyback on the work of design biologists Douglas Axe and Michael Behe.  They had identified certain subcellular systems . . . that proved highly resistant to Darwinian explanations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely my point!  “Piggyback” is a more polite term than “parasitic,” but my term is more accurate.  It is the claims made by Behe and Axe that are doing all the work in the argument that evolution as currently understood is seriously deficient.  Dembski’s calculations are irrelevant, in addition to being incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the last quote, Dembski writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our joint task was to put plausible numbers to these systems so that even factoring in Darwinian natural selection, the probability of those systems arising was exceedingly small.  Note that the specification of these systems, as in their exhibiting the right sort of a pattern for a design inference, was never in question.  The issue was always whether the probabilities were small enough.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski’s calculations do not, in even the slightest way, “factor in” Darwinian natural selection.  Instead, they use certain claims made by Behe and Axe to justify ignoring natural selection altogether.  Once again, it is those claims, and not Dembski’s pointless calculations, that are doing all the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, note how dismissive he is of establishing “specificity” in his idiosyncratic sense.  This, again, was precisely my point.  Dembski and his supporters tell the world he has a mathematically rigorous way of distinguishing real patterns from artificial ones.  But that mathematical machinery plays no role at all in his actual argument that the flagellum, say, is specified.  Apparently, to specify a flagellum it is sufficient to say, “Kinda looks like an outboard motor.”  Nothing rigorous about it.  And since biologists argue that natural selection crafts functional systems as a matter of course, I would say the question of specificity is very much in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this excerpt is representative of the rest of the book, then I do not think his critics have anything to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish with an extended analogy.  Suppose someone tells you they drew five cards from a shuffled deck and that all were the same suit.  He asks you to work out the probability of that happening.  No problem, that is a basic calculation.  But then he gives you a plot twist.  He tells you that his deck has millions of cards and dozens of suits, and that he will not be any more specific than that.  At this point you laugh and say you need more information to find the probability, thinking that you had just stated the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now an ID proponent charges into the room.  He says, “Of course you can work out the probability.  Just assume there are exactly one million cards and forty suits, with the same number of cards in each suit.”  He then scribbles down elaborate calculations involving factorials and binomial coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astonished that anyone would seriously put forth such a thing, you reply that his calculation is silly since it is based on entirely arbitrary assumptions.  But he just ignores you and says, “And not only is this improbable, but it’s also specified!  I mean, seriously, five cards of the same suit.  What an obvious pattern!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you are face-palming and rolling your eyes.  You point out that since we know nothing about the distribution of suits in this deck, we have no idea if it is remarkable to get five cards of the same suit.  You say, “For all we know one suit is so overrepresented in the deck that getting five of the same suit is close to inevitable.”  Again, you are surprised you need to point this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the ID proponent is undaunted.  He shouts, “You’re just a dogmatic, anti-religious tool of the scientific mafia.”  Then he runs out of the room and writes books telling the world about how he has revolutionized mathematics, biology, and philosophy.  His sycophants start calling him the Isaac Newton of information theory.  Meanwhile, you are left wondering what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End scene.  I think that captures the frustration scientists feel when addressing ID proponents.  Except that there is one point where my analogy does not go far enough: In the analogy, the assumptions underlying the calculation were merely unjustified.  In Dembski’s writing, the assumptions are plainly false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski packs an astonishing amount of error into such a short excerpt, and there is much more to comment on than what I have presented here.  But we will save that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason Rosenhouse</name></author><summary type="html">Last year, I published a book called The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism with Cambridge University Press.

However, Dembski has posted an excerpt from the book’s Introduction, and I was delighted to see that, perhaps inadvertently, he has simply conceded two of the main points I raised against his ideas.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pterocomma sp.</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/pterocomma-sp.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pterocomma sp." /><published>2023-11-13T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-11-13T12:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/pterocomma-sp</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/pterocomma-sp.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Martyn Iles. &lt;small&gt;Fair Use&lt;/small&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martyn Iles, who first joined Answers in Genesis in May of this year, is now Executive CEO. Iles announced this development on his own Facebook page with, the next day, an identical emailing from Answers in Genesis to its supporters, and an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vision.org.au/faith/martyn-iles-answers-in-genesis-ceo/&quot;&gt;Martin Iles: Answers in Genesis CEO&lt;/a&gt;, in Vision Christian Media, by Tony Davenport. The article is mainly devoted to Iles’s own statement, with a flattering headshot and minimal mention of Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iles’s ascendance is very bad news indeed, not only because he is a formidable figure, but also because he is explicitly far more political than Ham ever revealed himself to be. On January 21, 2021, two weeks after the Capitol riot, Iles, who was still at that time managing director of the politically explicit Australian Christian Lobby, posted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Donald Trump's term in the White House ends today, so I thought I'd share this crucial highlight of his presidency... Thanks President Trump, from an Aussie who still likes you and is happy to admit it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlight consists of Trump making pugnacious gestures to an applauding crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, in a podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/BrBgSjAC7kE&quot;&gt;The truth of it&lt;/a&gt;, Episode 55, shortly after the November, 2020 election, Iles noted the narrow margins in some states, drawing attention to lawsuits, and claimed that suspicion of fraud was reasonable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's a radical strand [of people on the left]… Do you really think that they wouldn't—they wouldn’t have a little tamper with a vote to stop a man who they believe is literally Hitler?… Of course, they would. … I mean, forgive me for thinking that someone who sets fire to a church wouldn't mess with 10,000 ballots. Of course, they would. Of course, they would.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here, Iles is presumably trying to link the election result to nebulous allegations of damage by un-named rioters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iles’s statement announcing his appointment, quoted in Davenport’s article, he mentions two new concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as scientific naturalism has threatened the faith of so many, post-modernism and new critical theories threaten the faith of a new generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the reference to &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; critical theories interesting. Churches have been dealing with textual criticism of the Bible for over a century, so I suspect that he is referring to critical theories of society, such as Critical Race Theory. As Governor DeSantis’s policies in Florida show, criticism of CRT is now used to attack any teaching that questions conservative dogma, much as 70 years ago such questioning was condemned as Communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmodernism was a bit of a surprise, but Mike Johnson has also attacked postmodernism, in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2023/10/learning-about-darwin-causes-mass-shootings-according-to-mike-johnson.html&quot;&gt;2017 Shreveport Christian Center speech&lt;/a&gt;.There he referred to postmodernism, which he described as a $10 word that he needed to explain to his audience, as among the results of studying Darwin, because it elevates individual opinion over the one and only Truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have yet to see how Answers in Genesis will evolve under its new management, and how it will affect long-standing members of the AIG team, such as Ham’s son-in-law Bodie Hodge, who has been with Answers in Genesis for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is the text of the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great honour to announce I have been elevated to the position of Executive CEO by the board of Answers in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear not – Ken Ham is still the Founding CEO. We are leading together for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an arrangement designed to set Answers in Genesis up for the future. It means our feet are firmly planted on our foundations whilst we adapt to a new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture is changing, fast. The next generation is different. Digital technology is disrupting our existence.
Just as scientific naturalism has threatened the faith of so many, postmodernism and new critical theories threaten the faith of a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But God’s word is a word for every generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the gospel is God’s answer to every generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will adapt to that which is new, holding fast to that which is timeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please pray for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unless the Lord builds the house, those that labour build it in vain.” (Ps 127:1)&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, Mr. Phelps read an October 27 tweet (or a twX or whatever they are called now) in which Mr. Ham proclaimed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At @AiG we have stated so many times before that the Ark was funded 100% by private funding. Let me say it again, the @ArkEncounter project and the @CreationMuseum were both funded 100% from private funding. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps notes that the Ark receives a sales tax rebate of $1.825 million every year. Perhaps, he says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Ham could always decide not to cash the check and return it to the Commonwealth of Kentucky if he wishes to keep claiming lack of government support. However, even if he returned the sales tax rebate money, he would still be getting or has received all sorts of other money and benefits from state, county, and city sources. These include and have included: &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;City of Williamstown sold Ark 98 acres of land for $1. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City also gave AIG $175,000 in cash. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City reduced property tax on Ark. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;City issued $62 million in unsecured junk bonds for Ark construction. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;75% of Ark Encounter's property taxes will go to repaying bonds instead of to local government. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Employees of Ark Encounter must pay 2% of wages to Ark bond debt (for next 30 years). &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;State transportation cabinet spent $11 million to upgrade Interstate 75 exits in anticipation of huge traffic increase that did not occur. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;AIG claims Ark is worth $130 million on 990 forms to Federal government and potentially when getting loans. Grant County property tax valuation (which supports local schools) assesses Ark value at $48 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire tweet (or whatever) is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, a headline in an unspecified newspaper proclaimed that Representative Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House of the moment, had once funded a Noah’s Ark theme park. Mr. Ham categorizes this claim as a lie. Whether or not it is a lie or merely an error, Mr. Phelps notes that on this point only, Mr. Ham is correct. Interestingly, though, Mr. Johnson once successfully represented the Ark in a suit against the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article44504949.html&quot;&gt;this diatribe&lt;/a&gt; against Mr. Phelps under the head, “Ark Park unfairly damned.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Our indefatigable colleague Dan Phelps seems to have caught Ken Ham in a, um, mild prevarication and corrects the record here.

The occasion was the publication of Robert Sapolsky’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Determined-Science-Life-without-Free-ebook/dp/B0BSKQ5ZDM/&quot;&gt;Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will&lt;/a&gt;. Sapolsky, in turn, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/science/free-will-sapolsky.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Hope Reese in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. The online title, incidentally, was “Robert Sapolsky doesn’t believe in free will. (But feel free to disagree.)”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne, Sapolsky, and I are what are called “hard determinists”: we think that “all our actions are determined by the laws of physics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know what all the fuss is about; any physicist could have told them that. Indeed, I said it myself in a 2001 book on science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was &lt;i&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe&lt;/i&gt;. It suffered from two main problems: (1) It was 5 or 10 years ahead of its time, and (2) it was not shrill enough and too sympathetic to religion. I have long ago given up the idea of becoming rich on it, and you may read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the point: In that book, I argued that humans were biological creatures and therefore governed by the laws of physics. Those laws are deterministic (we will get back to that in a minute), so everything we do, think, or decide is determined by those laws. We may think we have free will; we certainly have to act as if we have free will; but in fact we have no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before you get your knickers in a twist, none of the foregoing implies, for example, that we should not punish criminals. The pain they may inflict is real, and we may have to separate them from society until (or unless) they reform. I suggest, however, that their lack of free will suggests that we should be rehabilitating rather than punishing criminals. But that discussion is a little off-task here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wrote &lt;i&gt;NSO&lt;/i&gt;, I assumed that quantum mechanics was itself purely deterministic and that some day we would discover an underlying, deterministic theory. It simply seemed unreasonable that, for example, an atomic nucleus would decide all on its own to emit an alpha particle, rather than being caused to do so by some external agency. It still seems unreasonable to me, but it may not be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does quantum mechanics then come to our rescue and somehow grant free will? No. First, so many molecules are involved in, say, neurotransmission that their action may be considered completely classical and therefore completely deterministic. Even so, the occasional quantum fluctuation would not so much grant free will as it would make our decisions somewhat random, a condition that I think proponents of free will would not particularly care for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum randomness may have been critically important to the evolution of the early universe. If we ran the “experiment” again, we might, for all I know, end up with a very different universe, one that does not even include us. That said, quantum randomness has very little effect on our daily lives, unless you count, for example, cancers induced by radioactive decay or cosmic radiation. Thus, as Sapolsky would argue, everything we think, say, and do is wholly and unequivocally determined by our detailed histories (except, as I have noted, for the occasional quantum fluctuation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conclude, then, that we have no free will in any sense. I do not understand why some people consider that threatening; it simply is the way it is. We feel as if we have free will, we act as if we have free will, and we are treated as if we have free will. Free will is thus a useful fiction, but in reality it is only a fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will undoubtedly read Sapolsky’s book when I get a chance. I think, though, that I will end with a complaint, one that I have made before: The Kindle edition of this book, which I may lease but not own, costs $18.99. The hardcover costs $23.28, and the paperback $12.95. Thus, I am expected to spend $6.04 for the convenience of leasing the Kindle edition, rather than owning the paperback edition. I was not going to write this paragraph, but I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Jerry Coyne ran an article the other day on the question of free will.
