The WV News noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lionel Dahmer, the father of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer – the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/crime/jeffrey-dahmer&quot;&gt;Milwaukee Monster&lt;/a&gt;&quot; who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys (mostly African Americans) – died on December 5, 2023. Lionel was the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781635615630&quot;&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/a&gt;, a memoir of his son's youth first published in 1994. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/us/lionel-dahmer-dead.html&quot;&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;Mr. Dahmer described himself in his book as ‘almost totally analytical'—a chemist, comforted by the scientific predictability of his work, whose emotional life resembled a ‘broad, flat plain.'&quot; But in fact, Lionel underwent a conversion experience in 1989 that affected not only his conception of the relation between religion and science, but also how his son is remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tSxuyM93Js&quot;&gt;Interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt;'s Stone Phillips in 1994, Jeffrey characterized evolution as the idea that &quot;we all just came from the slime,&quot; described it as &quot;a complete lie … [with] no basis in science to uphold it,&quot; and contended that &quot;the whole theory cheapens life.&quot; Implicit in his rambling remarks is the following argument: evolution entails that there is no God to whom we are morally accountable; only if there is a God to whom we are morally accountable is there reason for us to behave morally; therefore, accepting evolution robs us of any reason to behave morally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of any reader inclined to take their scientific or philosophical pointers from a college drop-out like Jeffrey, it should be noted that the scientific consensus on evolution is overwhelming, with over 98 percent of American scientists accepting human evolution in a 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-express-strikingly-different-views-about-science-related-issues/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;; that evolution, like science in general, is typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5787/chapter/6#58&quot;&gt;regarded&lt;/a&gt; as intrinsically silent on the existence of God; and that there are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/&quot;&gt;plethora&lt;/a&gt; of philosophical accounts of morality in which God is not central. It's also not clear why slime is supposed to be a worse origin than the Biblical alternative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;the dust of the ground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet creationists are disturbingly fond of invoking Jeffrey Dahmer. To take a few examples at random: the creationist ministries &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/search/?refinement=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;q=dahmer&quot;&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://creation.com/search?q=dahmer&quot;&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt; discuss Jeffrey in virtually identical terms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/trouble-paradise&quot;&gt;reflecting&lt;/a&gt; their common ancestry; a professor of philosophy at a fundamentalist university paraphrased the &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; remarks while participating in a three-way &lt;a href=&quot;https://zondervanacademic.com/products/three-views-on-creation-and-evolution&quot;&gt;internecine creationist debate&lt;/a&gt;; and Jeffrey is credited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5661968/&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt; as appearing in &quot;Kent Hovind: An Atheist's Worst Nightmare,&quot; a 2006 self-promoting film from a flamboyant creationist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2015/07/10/hovind-free-jail-back-pensacola/29969745/&quot;&gt;convicted felon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these invocations reach a broader audience. In 2009, for example, as the Texas state board of education was conducting a revision of the state science standards, members of the radical Christian right were hoping for the retention of &quot;strengths and weaknesses&quot; language that was invoked as a pretext to undermine the teaching of evolution. The Texas Freedom Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfn.org/jeffrey-dahmer-believed-in-evolution/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time on a lobbying email with the unsubtle all-caps subject line &quot;JEFFREY DAHMER, SERIAL KILLER, BELIEVED IN EVOLUTION—WHY ‘WEAKNESSES' NEEDS TO STAY IN TEXAS SCIENCE STANDARDS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is Jeffrey's claim that he formerly believed that evolution licensed his ghastly crimes actually evidence of anything? Even if he was sincere and accurate, it would be unwarranted to generalize from his single case, as Lionel conceded in the appendix to the 2021 edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781635615630&quot;&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/a&gt;. And while he may have been sincere—Roy Ratliff, who ministered to him in prison, reported similar remarks from him in his own book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9780976779025&quot;&gt;Dark Journey Deep Grace: Jeffrey Dahmer's Story of Faith&lt;/a&gt;—there is no reason to regard him as insightful about his own twisted psyche, and no evidence that he was interested in evolution before his imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a plausible source for Jeffrey's claim independent of his own murderous career: creationism itself. In the appendix to the 2021 edition of &lt;i&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/i&gt;, Lionel revealed that from 1989 onward he was sending &quot;tapes and articles&quot; espousing creationism to his son, who (according to Lionel) ignored them until after his imprisonment. Roy Ratliff reported that while in prison Jeffrey continued to receive material from his father discussing &quot;the creation of the world and how evolution is untrue,&quot; which Jeffrey credited with bringing him to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is inevitable that the creationist materials that Lionel plied Jeffrey with, before and after his imprisonment, contained a hefty dose of the claim that acceptance of evolution causes moral bankruptcy. Indeed, the idea that accepting evolution is connected to religious apostasy, moral turpitude, and social decay is among the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://shuddhashar.com/learning-from-the-american-evolution-wars/&quot;&gt;pillars of creationism&lt;/a&gt;, the main rhetorical themes used by creationists hoping to influence the public. Subsisting on such a doctrinaire diet, it is hardly surprising that Jeffrey was primed to repeat the claim during his &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why was Lionel sending creationist materials to Jeffrey? In the initial edition of &lt;i&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/i&gt;, Lionel was circumspect about his attitude toward evolution. He wrote that while in prison in 1992, his son used $130, anonymously donated, to purchase thirteen creationist books, neutrally adding, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It amazed him that a scientific theory that had been received as an unarguable scientific fact during all the years of his education might rest on questionable assumptions. It seemed to delight him that so thoroughly accepted an idea could be questioned, that nothing stood on truly solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the appendix to the 2021 edition of his book, however, Lionel disclosed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989, I myself ‘returned' fully to God, being influenced by the urging of my son, Dave, and profoundly affected by a seminar presented by a scientist from Montgomery, Alabama, Dr. Bert Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thompson was indeed a scientist, earning a Ph.D. in microbiology from Texas A&amp;amp;M University in 1975, but he spent the bulk of his career &quot;spread[ing] young-earth creationism throughout the Churches of Christ,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9780674023390&quot;&gt;as the historian Ronald L. Numbers wrote&lt;/a&gt;, including through a ministry called Apologetics Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Thompson, Lionel was briefly active in organized creationism himself, presenting a poster at the 1990 International Conference on Creationism and publishing a 1991 &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1458&amp;amp;context=icc_proceedings&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the conference's proceedings. The research purported to challenge the scientifically ascertained dates of dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our radiocarbon dates of dinosaur bones and the other information in this report should be alarming to the evolutionary community and should be given serious study considering our preliminary results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: the &quot;evolutionary community&quot; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nabt.org/files/galleries/February2020ABT.pdf&quot;&gt;unmoved&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, pp. 72-79).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in light of the proclivity of creationists to quote Jeffrey's &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; interview to illustrate the claim that accepting evolution causes moral bankruptcy, the career of the second author of Lionel's paper—Dmitri A. Kouznetsov, then a superstar of Russian creationism—imploded in the mid-1990s owing to accusations of scholarly dishonesty. According to the historian Ronald L. Numbers, Kouznetsov then reinvented himself as a supposed expert on the Shroud of Turin, &quot;using fake samples from nonexistent museums,&quot; and subsequently served time for passing bad checks in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is similarly ironic that Bert Thompson, whom Lionel credited with his return to God, was fired from Apologetics Press in 2005, amid accusations of sexual misconduct. &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianchronicle.org/longtime-director-of-apologetics-press-fired/&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to a story in &lt;i&gt;The Christian Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, which serves the Churches of Christ, a member of the church alleged that &quot;Thompson started sending him cards and letters when he was 13, then pressed him to go out to dinner after he turned 16, the legal age of consent in Alabama.&quot; After dinner, Thompson took the youth to his home and &quot;lured him to a bedroom, disrobed and touched him inappropriately.&quot; It was not the only such accusation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Lionel was aware of or troubled by the alleged moral failings of his collaborator and his inspiration is unclear. In any case, he seems not to have been active in organized creationism after 1991, which is not surprising given the disruption of his life by his son's arrest, trial, conviction, imprisonment, and murder. But he continued to harbor doubts about the scientific bona fides of evolution, judging from the appendix to the 2021 edition of his memoir, and he still appears in propagandistic lists of scientists who accept creationism, including the list put out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://creation.com/scientists-alive-today-who-accept-the-biblical-account-of-creation&quot;&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lionel Dahmer, the father of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer – the &quot;Milwaukee Monster&quot; who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys (mostly African Americans) – died on December 5, 2023. Lionel was the author of A Father's Story, a memoir of his son's youth first published in 1994. According to the obituary in The New York Times, &quot;Mr. Dahmer described himself in his book as ‘almost totally analytical'—a chemist, comforted by the scientific predictability of his work, whose emotional life resembled a ‘broad, flat plain.'&quot; But in fact, Lionel underwent a conversion experience in 1989 that affected not only his conception of the relation between religion and science, but also how his son is remembered.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Structural phylogenetics and Kitzmiller vs. Dover</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/structural-phylogenetics-KvD.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Structural phylogenetics and Kitzmiller vs. Dover" /><published>2024-01-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-01-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/structural-phylogenetics-KvD</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/structural-phylogenetics-KvD.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig6_PDB_trees.png&quot; alt=&quot;[Figure 1 of Puente-Lelievre, Matzke et al. 2023, Tertiary-interaction characters enable fast, model-based structural phylogenetics beyond the twilight zone, bioRxiv]&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly late Merry Kitzmas to all! The 2005 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Kitzmiller+v.+Dover%2C+panda%27s+thumb&quot;&gt;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; case, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html&quot;&gt;“Intelligent Design” went on trial&lt;/a&gt; (Matzke 2006) is now 18 years old. Amazingly, 18 years is the same number of years as between the 1987 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html&quot;&gt;Edwards v. Aguillard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Supreme Court decision and &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/i&gt;. I would say that the prominence of antievolutionism has receded in the latter 18 years, compared to numerous other culture wars, real wars, and challenges to the fundamentals of science-informed liberal democracy that have dominated the news in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/i&gt; has definitely had a positive impact. However, we should keep in mind that Alabama &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;still&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; has a warning label in its textbooks (see this story by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al.com/educationlab/2023/11/alabama-to-update-science-standards-keep-evolution-disclaimer.html&quot;&gt;Trisha Crain, 2023, al.com&lt;/a&gt;), several “critical analysis” antievolution policies remain on the books (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aad4057&quot;&gt;Matzke 2015&lt;/a&gt;), for example the Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/how-mike-johnson-helped-open-door-creationism-louisiana-public-schools&quot;&gt;NCSE 2023&lt;/a&gt;), and keeps evolving (&lt;a href=&quot;http://phylo.wikidot.com/matzke-2015-science-paper-on-the-evolution-of-antievolution&quot;&gt;Matzke 2015&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/how-mike-johnson-helped-open-door-creationism-louisiana-public-schools&quot;&gt;Creation-museum-boosting young-earth creationist Mike Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is Speaker of the US House and third in line to the Presidency, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/aftermath-texass-disappointing-vote-science-textbooks&quot;&gt;Texas Board of Education is still blocking textbooks with coverage of evolution and climate change that they don’t like&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  As Rob Pennock always says, “stay vigilant!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longtime PT readers may recall some interesting scientific publications that came out of the &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/i&gt; case, mostly reviewing the relevant science. Examples include the evolutionary origin of the immune system (Bottaro, Inlay, and Matzke 2006, &lt;i&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/i&gt;; see also posts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/04/pt-posters-in-n.html&quot;&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/annotated-bibliography-evolutionary-origin-vertebrate-immune-system&quot;&gt;NCSE&lt;/a&gt;), the evolutionary origin of complex adaptations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0701505104&quot;&gt;Scott and Matzke 2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/05/nas-sackler-col.html&quot;&gt;PT post&lt;/a&gt;), or tracking the “evolution” of antievolution bills (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4057&quot;&gt;Matzke 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4057&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/12/bonus-material.html&quot;&gt;PT post&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://phylo.wikidot.com/matzke-2015-science-paper-on-the-evolution-of-antievolution&quot;&gt;free online Supplemental Data&lt;/a&gt;). Another was on the evolution of the bacterial flagellum (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro1493&quot;&gt;Pallen &amp;amp; Matzke, 2006, &lt;i&gt;Nature Reviews Microbiology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/flagellum-evolu.html&quot;&gt;PT post&lt;/a&gt;), which I think crossed over into novel research on the origin of a complex adaptation, even though the article was mostly assembling previous findings into a coherent scenario. I have maintained an interest in the evolution of the flagellum, and I would like to present some new research that, in a roundabout way, derives from the flagellum work and from &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am part of a team on a Human Frontier Science Program research grant that is combining phylogenetic, modeling, and experimental approaches to further understanding the evolutionary origin of the bacterial flagellum.  The group is headed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-matthew-baker&quot;&gt;Matt Baker at the University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge that has always been a barrier to using phylogenetics to understand the origins of the flagellum is the system’s great age.  It may well be that the flagellum was present in the last common ancestor of (known, extant) bacteria, which probably means the system is 2.5+ billion years old.  The other famous systems that the intelligent design (ID) movement latched onto were much younger: the eukaryotic cilium (or flagellum) is probably as old as eukaryotes, perhaps 1.5 billion years; the adaptive immune system and blood-clotting cascades arose within the vertebrates and so are less than 500 million years old.  While phylogenetics is useful for understanding the origin of all these systems, even the bacterial flagellum, it’s just harder for the flagellum, as even the best conserved homologous proteins can have amino acid (AA) sequence similarity that has decayed to 30% or less. Homology detection, sequence alignment, and accurate phylogenies all become substantially harder as AA sequence similarity decays below 30%, especially below 25% and 20% and below. Eventually similarity decays to random background similarity and homology searches, alignments, etc. return nothing convincing, or, worse, they return something that is a little bit plausible but is actually just a chance match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This zone below 30% AA sequence identity has long been known as the Twilight Zone of protein phylogenetics (this phrase goes back at least as far as Russell Doolittle in the 1980s, probably further).  The main solution when homology/alignment/phylogenetics gets difficult due to loss of signal in the characters is: find more characters, ideally characters that are more slowly evolving. We already do this in many areas: if DNA sequence similarity is saturated, we can move to AA sequence, or morphological characters, both of which tend to be more slowly evolving, and thus preserve evidence of shared ancestry (shared derived characters) for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protein structure phylogenetics in the Twilight Zone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have another source of data in the Twilight Zone, which &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to be helpful: protein structure. It has long been known that protein structure is even more conserved than amino acid sequence. However, use of protein structure in phylogenetics has been limited by two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Protein structures are very hard to experimentally characterize. Techniques like protein crystallography only work on certain proteins, and require a great deal of time, effort, and expensive equipment. Therefore, protein structures have historically only been available for a small fraction of the gene/protein sequences available after the DNA sequencing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Converting a protein structure into a series of discrete characters that can be analyzed by phylogenetics software is a nontrivial problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, my best idea to solve problem #2 was to kidnap a few crystallographers and other protein structure experts and lock them in a basement until they came up with a manual character coding scheme for protein structures, and then used it to produce a character matrix.  Much like paleontologists and morphologists manually describe the anatomy of their specimens and code this into a morphological character matrix for computational analysis, we could do the same thing with protein structure – at least if we can run faster than crystallographers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, two recent developments have radically changed what seems possible.  First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;AlphaFold2&lt;/a&gt; and similar projects appear to have finally cracked the problem of predicting protein structure from AA sequence. While it’s not perfect, it appears to be pretty good. In 2024 (unlike 2020), we can input an AA sequence and get a pretty good structural prediction out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, bioinformaticians (namely Martin Steinegger and colleagues) have figured out a way to code some of the 3-dimensional structural features of a protein structure into a linear alphabet of characters. This was done in the program &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.foldseek.com/search&quot;&gt;Foldseek&lt;/a&gt;, used for homology searches deep into the Twilight Zone. The alphabet is called “3Di” (3-dimension).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the University of Auckland, my postdoc &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/caroline-puente-lelievre&quot;&gt;Caroline Puente-Lelievre&lt;/a&gt;, and students and colleagues, were discussing and working with Foldseek, and it very gradually dawned on us that if the Foldseek 3Di alphabet was useful for homology search, it might be useful for phylogenetic inference as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first explored this possibility on flagellum proteins, but then we realized that we had stumbled on something that might be the basis for improved phylogenetic inference for almost any protein clade that had diverged into the Twilight Zone.  So we wrote a paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puente-Lelievre, Caroline; Malik, Ashar J.; Douglas, Jordan; Ascher, David; Baker, Matthew; Allison, Jane; Poole, Anthony; Lundin, Daniel; Fullmer, Matthew; Bouckert, Remco; Kim, Hyunbin; Steinegger, Martin; Matzke, Nicholas J.

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this story has been told in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1735089150494470339&quot;&gt;thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (now “X”, ugh), also &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nickjmatzke.bsky.social/post/3kghoyoeqta23&quot;&gt;posted to Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, but honestly, microblogging platforms are kind of lame now, they mostly require logins to read much. So I am re-posting the thread and graphics below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twitter thread on Puente-Lelievre et al. (2023), “Tertiary-interaction characters enable fast, model-based structural phylogenetics beyond the twilight zone.” &lt;i&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tweetorial explainer on Puente-Lelievre et al (2023). We are very excited about this paper &amp;amp; its implications for phylogenetics. Here’s why! (Work stems from @HFSP grant “How life got moving: reconstructing and re-evolving the bacterial flagellar motor” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SBSatEd/status/1380517373107666945&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/SBSatEd/status/1380517373107666945&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein structure is more conserved than amino acid (AA) sequence. There are many cases where AA identity has decayed towards undetectability, yet the 3D protein structures are superimposable (Illergård et al. 2009) &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22458&quot;&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22458&lt;/a&gt; /2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Illergard_etal_2009_structure_conserved_sequence.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural conservation is often exploited in deep homology search and alignment, e.g. in the program Foldseek by @thesteinegger lab. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01773-0&quot;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01773-0&lt;/a&gt; . Caroline Puente-Lelievre &amp;amp; I were using Foldseek on deeply-diverged proteins of the bacterial flagellum. /3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Foldseek_paper.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to thinking - like many before us - about whether we could use protein structure in phylogenetics. Eg Ashar Malik @proteinmechanic (2020) used structural distances &amp;amp; Molecular Dynamics sims to do bootstrapping for uncertainty. Took ~3 weeks. https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/9/2711/5821432 /4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Malik_etal_2020.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, distance-based methods are hard to integrate into modern statistical phylogenetics, which is based on probabilistic models which enable a huge range of tools: Maximum Likelihood &amp;amp; Bayesian inference, statistical model comparison, formal measures of uncertainty, &amp;amp; speed. /5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played with Foldseek for like a year for homology search, but slowly it dawned on us that its method - converting 3D structures into a 1D sequence of “3Di” states - might be useful not just for rapid structural homology search, but for phylogenetic inference. /6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we thought, “Surely someone has thought of this already and therefore it’s either a dumb idea, or it’s coming out next week.” But @AucklandUni has a bunch of structural-phylogenetics-curious, &amp;amp; Caroline, &amp;amp; Jordan Douglas, organized ASPM2023 meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SimonJGreenhill/status/1691570184044339573&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/SimonJGreenhill/status/1691570184044339573&lt;/a&gt; /7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Structural_phylo_meeting.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All* the cool kids of structural phylogenetics were there: https://twitter.com/phatmattbaker/status/1735052775418183873 (*=not really all, obviously. But, a bunch of people with that interest) /8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Structural_phylo_attendees.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ASPM2023 we realized it was up to us to explore the idea of 3Dis-in-model-based phylogenetics. Moi @steg0s4urus &amp;amp; @thesteinegger lab had just published Foldtree, using 3Di structural alignments to improve AA-distance based phylogenies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/thesteinegger/status/1707057683600482813?s=20&quot;&gt;https://x.com/thesteinegger/status/1707057683600482813?s=20&lt;/a&gt; /9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March through the figures of Puente-Lelievre et al. 2023. Here’s a summary of how Foldseek turns a 3D structure file into a sequence of 3Di characters. This takes &amp;lt;1s and gives a 3Di state for each AA in a structure. The Foldseek command is “structureto3didescriptor.” /10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig1_foldseek_3di.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a comparison of AA and 3Di alignments for 53 PDB structures from the Ferritin-like Superfamily, used for “M20”: Malik et al.’s (2020) neighbor-joining distances tree. Coloring is percent identity. Holy moly those 3Di states are CONSERVED! /11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig2_alignment.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a zoom-in on part of the alignment. 3Di states seem to have different information than the AAs. If we treat these as phylogenetic characters, would they help resolve things deep in the tree, the “twilight zone” where sequence identity is 30%, 20% or lower? /12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig3_alignment.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foldseek has an 3DI cost matrix for alignment calculations. We turned this into a 3DI rate matrix, and tossed it and the AA+3Di characters into the standard Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics program IQtree. Do 3Di characters seem to work like other characters? Yep! /13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Table2_model_selection.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually ran the data 60 ways in IQtree. The short version: when you use AA+3Di characters, &amp;amp; do all the things you’re supposed to do (structural alignment, model-fitting, partitioning, etc.), you get very close matches to the M20 tree. E.g. with PDB solved structures: /14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig6_PDB_trees.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, if anything the PDB-derived IQtree analysis is better than M20’s tree: it makes 2 likely groups missed in M20. And: LOOK AT THE RUNTIME. M20’s MD-based bootstrapping took ~3 weeks with parallelization. IQtree took 13.7 min. for 1000 UF bootstraps. On a desktop. /15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought that was cool, look at the next one. This time, we used AlphaFold-predicted structures instead of solved PDB structures. Pretty equivalent tree. But: AlphaFolds are available for…almost everything! &lt;i&gt;Anyone&lt;/i&gt; could do this on &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; dataset! /16 https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig7_PDB_trees.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we got when we just ran a standard analysis - amino-acids only, and aligned just using amino acids (although with a substitution matrix, MIQS in FAMSA, specialized for divergent proteins). Messy: long-branch attraction artifacts, clades exploding, etc. /17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/CPL_etal_2023_Fig8_AA_trees.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; this was just a proof-of-concept study, there needs to be study of the many caveats we mention in the manuscript (including philosophical!) etc. But: the future looks bright for structural phylogenetics, and anyone can try it on tough, deep phylogenetics problems! /18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Addendum:&lt;/b&gt; Matt Baker at @UNSW aka @phatmattbaker, ringleader of the @HFSP flagellum project, 3rd ranked fencer in Australia in his group, and general amazing guy, has a thread about his path to ASPM2023 and this paper: https://twitter.com/phatmattbaker/status/1735054924512387528 https://twitter.com/phatmattbaker/status/1735052739464585430 /19&lt;/p&gt;

A slightly late Merry Kitzmas to all! The 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board case, where “Intelligent Design” went on trial (Matzke 2006) is now 18 years old. Amazingly, 18 years is the same number of years as between the 1987 Edwards v. Aguillard Supreme Court decision and Kitzmiller. I would say that the prominence of antievolutionism has receded in the latter 18 years, compared to numerous other culture wars, real wars, and challenges to the fundamentals of science-informed liberal democracy that have dominated the news in recent years. In that sense, Kitzmiller has definitely had a positive impact. However, we should keep in mind that Alabama still has a warning label in its textbooks (see this story by Trisha Crain, 2023, al.com), several “critical analysis” antievolution policies remain on the books (Matzke 2015), for example the Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008 (NCSE 2023), and keeps evolving (Matzke 2015), Creation-museum-boosting young-earth creationist Mike Johnson is Speaker of the US House and third in line to the Presidency, the Texas Board of Education is still blocking textbooks with coverage of evolution and climate change that they don’t like, etc. As Rob Pennock always says, “stay vigilant!” Longtime PT readers may recall some interesting scientific publications that came out of the Kitzmiller case, mostly reviewing the relevant science. Examples include the evolutionary origin of the immune system (Bottaro, Inlay, and Matzke 2006, Nature Immunology; see also posts at PT and NCSE), the evolutionary origin of complex adaptations (Scott and Matzke 2007, PNAS; PT post), or tracking the “evolution” of antievolution bills (Matzke 2016, Science; PT post; free online Supplemental Data). Another was on the evolution of the bacterial flagellum (Pallen &amp;amp; Matzke, 2006, Nature Reviews Microbiology; PT post), which I think crossed over into novel research on the origin of a complex adaptation, even though the article was mostly assembling previous findings into a coherent scenario. I have maintained an interest in the evolution of the flagellum, and I would like to present some new research that, in a roundabout way, derives from the flagellum work and from Kitzmiller.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Great Sand Dunes National Park</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/great-sand-dunes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Great Sand Dunes National Park" /><published>2024-01-08T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-01-08T12:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/great-sand-dunes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/great-sand-dunes.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;C.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/Libbrecht_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost literally, as I was finishing the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Snowflake-Kenneth-Libbrecht-ebook/dp/B01G8U33WC &quot;&gt;The Snowflake: Winter’s Frozen Artistry&lt;/a&gt;, by Kenneth Libbrecht and Rachel Wing, I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/12/25/1217356234/just-how-big-can-a-snowflake-get-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-snowflake&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; on NPR: Professor Libbrecht had discovered and photographed what, as far as anyone knows, is the largest single-crystal snowflake ever discovered – approximately 10 mm across. The snowflake was evidently larger than the field of view of Prof Libbrecht’s microscope and had to be photographed in 4 quadrants, which were later digitally stitched together. The snowflake has been accepted in the Guinness Book of World Records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the book by Libbrecht and Wing, it is short, wastes hardly a word, and was a pleasure to read. It is not a technical book, nor is it a children’s book, yet I kept thinking that much of the early chapters would be an excellent way to stimulate an interest in science in, say, medium-sized children. As of this writing, you may get the Kindle edition of the book for approximately $3, US. I read it on a Kindle Paperwhite, which gives a small, black-and-white image, so I had to look at some of the images on a computer monitor in order to get full color and resolution. The formatting on the Kindle was not wonderful, but it was manageable. More below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wondered why the arms of a snowflake, which Libbrecht and Wing call a &lt;i&gt;stellar dendrite&lt;/i&gt;, are identical or nearly so. Of course, they are not always identical but why are they &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; identical? Libbrecht and Wing explain succinctly that under some conditions ice forms hexagonal structures (or at least corners of hexagonal structures) and under other conditions, branching arms. As conditions change and the snowflake encounters different temperature and humidity regimes, it alternately grows smooth, flat surfaces, or facets, and branches. By stunting their growth, the facets stabilize the otherwise unstable branches. At least sometimes, the conditions are constant across the snowflake, and over a period of minutes it evolves 6 identical arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientifically inclined may find the chapter, “A field guide to falling snow,” especially interesting. In that chapter, we learn that, besides snowflakes, water sometimes crystallizes into hexagonal plates, needles, or hexagonal cylinders. These contribute to many atmospheric effects such as sun dogs and halos. In addition, however, they sometimes form &lt;i&gt;capped columns&lt;/i&gt;, which look like microscopic dumbbells, and even 12-branched stars. The chapter concludes with frost, rime snow, and even a picture of a dendrite coated with rime snow. Children of all ages will learn how to fossilize a snowflake in superglue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly intrigued by Nakaya’s &lt;i&gt;snow crystal morphology diagram&lt;/i&gt;. Not exactly a graph, this diagram shows pictures of different kinds of ice crystal on a Cartesian plot with humidity on the vertical axis and temperature on the horizontal axis. Not surprisingly, we get plates and cylinders when the humidity is low and dendrites when the humidity is high. I found it curious that dendrites form just below freezing and well below freezing, but not between. Later in the book, Libbrecht and Wing inform us that this behavior remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have one quibble, it concerns the construction of the microscope. They use what appears to be a conventional microscope turret and a digital camera, but it is unclear whether the lens has been removed from the digital camera. With the right microscope objectives, you could do it either way. Some of the pictures, incidentally, are taken using something called &lt;i&gt;Rheinberg illumination&lt;/i&gt;, which is evidently oblique illumination using different colors simultaneously. I am supposed to know something about microscopy, but I will have to look that up right after I finish this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of Prof. Libbrecht in 2016, when he was featured in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/science/who-ever-said-no-two-snowflakes-were-alike.html&quot;&gt;article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. Under carefully controlled conditions, he had grown pairs of identical snowflakes, thus in a sense demonstrating the falsity of the claim that no two snowflakes are identical. He very generously let us &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/01/Identical-snowflakes.html&quot;&gt;post a pair of twins&lt;/a&gt; on PT in 2017. It is interesting how the snowflakes freeze water vapor from the air and clear themselves a region that is free of the frozen droplets that cover the rest of the microscope slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;My best snowflake! A single-crystal snowflake showing what appears to be a somewhat similar doppelgänger in the background.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I cannot resist, and I hope you will indulge me: Last year, at the very end of the season, I took a fairly fuzzy black cloth out into a cold, light snow flurry, let it chill for a while, and allowed some snowflakes to fall on it. The fuzz was to prevent the flake from landing on the cloth itself and potentially melting. I photographed some snowflakes with a handheld Sony ILCE 6000 with a 30-mm macro lens and the built-in flash (possibly with a diffuser, but I do not remember). Using some digital image processing software, I could easily crop the picture and end up with a picture of a snowflake around 600 pixels square. Not exactly the same quality as Libbrecht and Wing’s, but it could have been worse. Next time I will know enough to stretch the cloth tightly (because of the severely limited depth of field) and will probably use a short extension tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Hexagonal plate, which might have been a snowflake, if only ….
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I found a handful of hexagonal plates, which I now know could have been the seed for a single-crystal snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Frost on a window.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fooled with some frost on a window, which (I know now) grows very differently from a snowflake and probably follows the contours of what I will call shmear on the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more, I recommend that you get the book and in your own small way help support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/&quot;&gt;Prof. Libbrecht&lt;/a&gt;’s research at Caltech.

&lt;figcaption&gt;United States Representative Mike Johnson, official photo.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A week or so ago, in an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/12/creationism-again.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, we linked to an article in HuffPost, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739&quot;&gt;How Mike Johnson Helped Open the Door to Creationism in Louisiana Public Schools&lt;/a&gt;, by Paul Blumenthal. That article detailed not only how the Speaker of the House of Representatives represented the Ark Park in Kentucky, but also how he spurred the passage of laws allowing creationism into public school classrooms in Louisiana. Much of the content of that article depended on several people – Barbara Forrest, Glenn Branch, and Zach Kopplin – closely related to the National Center for Science Education, as detailed recently in the NCSE Monitor, an online magazine that I get every week in my e-mail. I feel a little bit like bragging vicariously, so here is the article from the Monitor, reprinted with permission. The original title of the article was the same as that of the HuffPost article. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support provided to creationism by Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the new Speaker of the House, was the topic of a detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in HuffPost (December 9, 2023) — and people associated with NCSE were a major source of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to the so-called Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008, the report summarized, “When the law faced challenges to its implementation and schools faced lawsuits for teaching creationism, Johnson, who worked as a senior litigator for the Alliance Defending Freedom and sat on the Louisiana Family Forum’s attorneys resources council, was the one to swoop in with legal memos, letters threatening lawsuits, and prayer rallies on behalf of the religious-right groups opposed to secular education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Forrest, a former member of NCSE’s board of directors, told HuffPost, “Johnson was always their legal go-to guy,” and Glenn Branch, NCSE’s Deputy Director, agreed, explaining that Johnson was “very involved” in the efforts of the law’s supporters to exclude a requirement that “[m]aterials that teach creationism or intelligent design or that advance the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind shall be prohibited for use in science classes” from the regulations implementing the LSEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report observed, “Since the law only allowed the optional introduction of supplementary materials challenging evolution with creationist theories, it has been hard to track the law’s usage in the decade-plus since its enactment.” NCSE’s Branch told HuffPost, “The same reason that makes it difficult to challenge the constitutionality of the Louisiana Science Education Act is the same reason that no one knows how effective [the law] is”: there seems to be no reliable data on the use of such materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the LSEA’s enactment, Zack Kopplin, a recipient of NCSE’s Friend of Darwin award, identified a number of Louisiana public schools in which creationism was taught. Johnson was involved in efforts to defend such schools, including in his own Bossier Parish, as Kopplin reported in Slate in 2015. Ultimately the Bossier Parish School Board was sued in 2018 over a pattern of actions violating the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause; the case was settled in 2019 with the board agreeing that there were violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Johnson “also signed on as the lawyer for another creationist cause up north in Kentucky: the Creation Museum, which opened in 2016,” helping the proprietor of the museum, the young-earth creationist ministry Answers in Genesis, to sue the state over its withdrawal of tourism subsidies. His interactions with Answers in Genesis continued; Johnson is on record as praising the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum as “one way to bring people to this recognition of the truth, that what we read in the Bible are actual historical events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kopplin was accorded the last word in the report.

A week or so ago, in an article here, we linked to an article in HuffPost, How Mike Johnson Helped Open the Door to Creationism in Louisiana Public Schools, by Paul Blumenthal. That article detailed not only how the Speaker of the House of Representatives represented the Ark Park in Kentucky, but also how he spurred the passage of laws allowing creationism into public school classrooms in Louisiana. Much of the content of that article depended on several people – Barbara Forrest, Glenn Branch, and Zach Kopplin – closely related to the National Center for Science Education, as detailed recently in the NCSE Monitor, an online magazine that I get every week in my e-mail. I feel a little bit like bragging vicariously, so here is the article from the Monitor, reprinted with permission. The original title of the article was the same as that of the HuffPost article. The support provided to creationism by Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the new Speaker of the House, was the topic of a detailed report in HuffPost (December 9, 2023) — and people associated with NCSE were a major source of information. Referring to the so-called Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008, the report summarized, “When the law faced challenges to its implementation and schools faced lawsuits for teaching creationism, Johnson, who worked as a senior litigator for the Alliance Defending Freedom and sat on the Louisiana Family Forum’s attorneys resources council, was the one to swoop in with legal memos, letters threatening lawsuits, and prayer rallies on behalf of the religious-right groups opposed to secular education.”</summary></entry></feed>
