&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/Libbrecht_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost literally, as I was finishing the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Snowflake-Kenneth-Libbrecht-ebook/dp/B01G8U33WC &quot;&gt;The Snowflake: Winter’s Frozen Artistry&lt;/a&gt;, by Kenneth Libbrecht and Rachel Wing, I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/12/25/1217356234/just-how-big-can-a-snowflake-get-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-snowflake&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; on NPR: Professor Libbrecht had discovered and photographed what, as far as anyone knows, is the largest single-crystal snowflake ever discovered – approximately 10 mm across. The snowflake was evidently larger than the field of view of Prof Libbrecht’s microscope and had to be photographed in 4 quadrants, which were later digitally stitched together. The snowflake has been accepted in the Guinness Book of World Records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the book by Libbrecht and Wing, it is short, wastes hardly a word, and was a pleasure to read. It is not a technical book, nor is it a children’s book, yet I kept thinking that much of the early chapters would be an excellent way to stimulate an interest in science in, say, medium-sized children. As of this writing, you may get the Kindle edition of the book for approximately $3, US. I read it on a Kindle Paperwhite, which gives a small, black-and-white image, so I had to look at some of the images on a computer monitor in order to get full color and resolution. The formatting on the Kindle was not wonderful, but it was manageable. More below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wondered why the arms of a snowflake, which Libbrecht and Wing call a &lt;i&gt;stellar dendrite&lt;/i&gt;, are identical or nearly so. Of course, they are not always identical but why are they &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; identical? Libbrecht and Wing explain succinctly that under some conditions ice forms hexagonal structures (or at least corners of hexagonal structures) and under other conditions, branching arms. As conditions change and the snowflake encounters different temperature and humidity regimes, it alternately grows smooth, flat surfaces, or facets, and branches. By stunting their growth, the facets stabilize the otherwise unstable branches. At least sometimes, the conditions are constant across the snowflake, and over a period of minutes it evolves 6 identical arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientifically inclined may find the chapter, “A field guide to falling snow,” especially interesting. In that chapter, we learn that, besides snowflakes, water sometimes crystallizes into hexagonal plates, needles, or hexagonal cylinders. These contribute to many atmospheric effects such as sun dogs and halos. In addition, however, they sometimes form &lt;i&gt;capped columns&lt;/i&gt;, which look like microscopic dumbbells, and even 12-branched stars. The chapter concludes with frost, rime snow, and even a picture of a dendrite coated with rime snow. Children of all ages will learn how to fossilize a snowflake in superglue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly intrigued by Nakaya’s &lt;i&gt;snow crystal morphology diagram&lt;/i&gt;. Not exactly a graph, this diagram shows pictures of different kinds of ice crystal on a Cartesian plot with humidity on the vertical axis and temperature on the horizontal axis. Not surprisingly, we get plates and cylinders when the humidity is low and dendrites when the humidity is high. I found it curious that dendrites form just below freezing and well below freezing, but not between. Later in the book, Libbrecht and Wing inform us that this behavior remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have one quibble, it concerns the construction of the microscope. They use what appears to be a conventional microscope turret and a digital camera, but it is unclear whether the lens has been removed from the digital camera. With the right microscope objectives, you could do it either way. Some of the pictures, incidentally, are taken using something called &lt;i&gt;Rheinberg illumination&lt;/i&gt;, which is evidently oblique illumination using different colors simultaneously. I am supposed to know something about microscopy, but I will have to look that up right after I finish this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of Prof. Libbrecht in 2016, when he was featured in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/science/who-ever-said-no-two-snowflakes-were-alike.html&quot;&gt;article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. Under carefully controlled conditions, he had grown pairs of identical snowflakes, thus in a sense demonstrating the falsity of the claim that no two snowflakes are identical. He very generously let us &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/01/Identical-snowflakes.html&quot;&gt;post a pair of twins&lt;/a&gt; on PT in 2017. It is interesting how the snowflakes freeze water vapor from the air and clear themselves a region that is free of the frozen droplets that cover the rest of the microscope slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;My best snowflake! A single-crystal snowflake showing what appears to be a somewhat similar doppelgänger in the background.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I cannot resist, and I hope you will indulge me: Last year, at the very end of the season, I took a fairly fuzzy black cloth out into a cold, light snow flurry, let it chill for a while, and allowed some snowflakes to fall on it. The fuzz was to prevent the flake from landing on the cloth itself and potentially melting. I photographed some snowflakes with a handheld Sony ILCE 6000 with a 30-mm macro lens and the built-in flash (possibly with a diffuser, but I do not remember). Using some digital image processing software, I could easily crop the picture and end up with a picture of a snowflake around 600 pixels square. Not exactly the same quality as Libbrecht and Wing’s, but it could have been worse. Next time I will know enough to stretch the cloth tightly (because of the severely limited depth of field) and will probably use a short extension tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Hexagonal plate, which might have been a snowflake, if only ….
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I found a handful of hexagonal plates, which I now know could have been the seed for a single-crystal snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Frost on a window.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fooled with some frost on a window, which (I know now) grows very differently from a snowflake and probably follows the contours of what I will call shmear on the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more, I recommend that you get the book and in your own small way help support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/&quot;&gt;Prof. Libbrecht&lt;/a&gt;’s research at Caltech. As he says, “Really, it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snowcrystals.com/books/books.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;perfect gift&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Almost literally, as I was finishing the book The Snowflake: Winter’s Frozen Artistry, by Kenneth Libbrecht and Rachel Wing, I heard this report on NPR: Professor Libbrecht had discovered and photographed what, as far as anyone knows, is the largest single-crystal snowflake ever discovered – approximately 10 mm across.

The link says that they are expanding northward into several southern states. Colorado seems a long way off (not to mention that it is cold and not exactly coastal). The lighting was poor (and flat), but I managed to get some pictures at ISO 1250, a number which would have been almost unheard of not so very long ago. The bird sat placidly posing for photographs, but was gone the next day. Thanks to Paul Strode for the identification.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A week or so ago, in an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/12/creationism-again.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, we linked to an article in HuffPost, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739&quot;&gt;How Mike Johnson Helped Open the Door to Creationism in Louisiana Public Schools&lt;/a&gt;, by Paul Blumenthal. That article detailed not only how the Speaker of the House of Representatives represented the Ark Park in Kentucky, but also how he spurred the passage of laws allowing creationism into public school classrooms in Louisiana. Much of the content of that article depended on several people – Barbara Forrest, Glenn Branch, and Zach Kopplin – closely related to the National Center for Science Education, as detailed recently in the NCSE Monitor, an online magazine that I get every week in my e-mail. I feel a little bit like bragging vicariously, so here is the article from the Monitor, reprinted with permission. The original title of the article was the same as that of the HuffPost article. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support provided to creationism by Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the new Speaker of the House, was the topic of a detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in HuffPost (December 9, 2023) — and people associated with NCSE were a major source of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to the so-called Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008, the report summarized, “When the law faced challenges to its implementation and schools faced lawsuits for teaching creationism, Johnson, who worked as a senior litigator for the Alliance Defending Freedom and sat on the Louisiana Family Forum’s attorneys resources council, was the one to swoop in with legal memos, letters threatening lawsuits, and prayer rallies on behalf of the religious-right groups opposed to secular education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Forrest, a former member of NCSE’s board of directors, told HuffPost, “Johnson was always their legal go-to guy,” and Glenn Branch, NCSE’s Deputy Director, agreed, explaining that Johnson was “very involved” in the efforts of the law’s supporters to exclude a requirement that “[m]aterials that teach creationism or intelligent design or that advance the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind shall be prohibited for use in science classes” from the regulations implementing the LSEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report observed, “Since the law only allowed the optional introduction of supplementary materials challenging evolution with creationist theories, it has been hard to track the law’s usage in the decade-plus since its enactment.” NCSE’s Branch told HuffPost, “The same reason that makes it difficult to challenge the constitutionality of the Louisiana Science Education Act is the same reason that no one knows how effective [the law] is”: there seems to be no reliable data on the use of such materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the LSEA’s enactment, Zack Kopplin, a recipient of NCSE’s Friend of Darwin award, identified a number of Louisiana public schools in which creationism was taught. Johnson was involved in efforts to defend such schools, including in his own Bossier Parish, as Kopplin reported in Slate in 2015. Ultimately the Bossier Parish School Board was sued in 2018 over a pattern of actions violating the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause; the case was settled in 2019 with the board agreeing that there were violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Johnson “also signed on as the lawyer for another creationist cause up north in Kentucky: the Creation Museum, which opened in 2016,” helping the proprietor of the museum, the young-earth creationist ministry Answers in Genesis, to sue the state over its withdrawal of tourism subsidies. His interactions with Answers in Genesis continued; Johnson is on record as praising the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum as “one way to bring people to this recognition of the truth, that what we read in the Bible are actual historical events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kopplin was accorded the last word in the report. Reflecting on his personal experience with Johnson, Kopplin reported that he found him to be polite and, unlike his allies, not “incredibly personally nasty.” He added, “But he’s from the same world, with the same goals.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">United States Representative Mike Johnson, official photo.

&lt;p&gt;Since last evening, I have received three disquieting e-mails that bear on creationism, in one form or another. I will give the links in the order in which I received them. Because I have not asked permission, I will not identify any of the senders; they are of course at liberty to identify themselves in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here below the figurative fold are the three links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, a penpal of mine sent me an e-mail detailing how the Kentucky government is promoting creationist theme parks. Specifically, the Louisville Courier-Journal announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/2023/12/08/ark-encounter-kentucky-faith-trail/71849424007/&quot;&gt;Religious tour of Kentucky: Faith Trail offers a new way to see the Bluegrass State&lt;/a&gt;, by Jolene Almendarez and Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez, subtitled,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Some of the sites are the Ark Encounter, the Creation Museum and the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Faith Trail will be funded by a $305,000 grant from the Commonwealth of Kentucky to the Northern Kentucky Convention and Visitors Bureau. There will be 11 stops on the Faith Trail, only two of them explicitly creationist, as far as I can tell, but yes, Answers in Genesis will receive free publicity from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, this morning another occasional penpal sent an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.city-journal.org/article/the-american-museum-of-natural-historys-politically-correct-creationism&quot;&gt;Politically correct creationism&lt;/a&gt;, by Elizabeth Weiss. The subtitle to the article tells you almost all you want to know or maybe do not want to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York's [American] Museum of Natural History presents indigenous origin myths and religious stories as scientific fact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article, published in the conservative magazine &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Journal&quot;&gt;City Journal&lt;/a&gt;, claims that the Museum now calls shamans “doctors,” a shortened form of witchdoctor. It is one thing to be sensitive to the religious traditions of indigenous peoples, but the museum seems to blur the distinction between fact and fiction when it writes, “By wearing masks that contained the spirits, doctors tapped into their power,” or appears to present creation myths as if they were history. I think it would be interesting if any of our readers have seen this exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, yet another penpal sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739&quot;&gt; How Mike Johnson helped open the door to creationism in Louisiana public schools&lt;/a&gt;, by Paul Blumenthal in the Huffington Post. Subtitles must be all the rage these days; this article is subtitled,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The House speaker is known for his work as a Christian-right operative. This is how he became the &quot;legal go-to guy&quot; to put creationism into public schools.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Johnson is the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Moment. Mr. Blumenthal notes that not only did Johnson represent the Ark Park, but also the represented religious-right forces that spurred the passage of laws allowing creationism into public-school classrooms in Louisiana. He also, according to my reading of the article, bullied the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education into allowing teachers to bring supplemental materials that teach creationism into the state’s public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago, in an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/10/do-we-have-free-will.html&quot;&gt;Do we have free will? No&lt;/a&gt;, I threatened to read Robert Sapolsky’s splendid book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Determined-Science-Life-without-Free-ebook/dp/B0BSKQ5ZDM/&quot;&gt;Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I read it, and we still do not have free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in my earlier article, I had myself argued that we lack free will in my book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe&lt;/a&gt;. My argument was kind of bare-bones, basically that we are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry, which are deterministic (except perhaps for the occasional quantum fluctuation), so our actions must also be deterministic. Though my wording was not the best, I also argued that criminals should therefore be rehabilitated or quarantined and not punished. Sapolsky fleshes all this out in great (if not excruciating) detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky thinks that it sounds “nuts” to claim that we have no free will. Not to me: it seems to me that the claim follows from first principles. But Sapolsky devotes several chapters to describing how neurons work, how they cause us to “pull the trigger,” and, more importantly, how they make us decide whether or not to pull the trigger. Early on he remarks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Show me a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior is independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you have demonstrated free will. The point of the first half of this book is to establish that this cannot be shown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sapolsky says “free will,” he does not mean that your decision was not coerced; rather he means that, given free rein, &lt;i&gt;you could have made no other decision than the one you did&lt;/i&gt;. For Sapolsky, the neuron that told you to tighten your muscle and pull some hypothetical trigger was influenced by another neuron that was itself chosen by one part of the brain telling it, “Go!” and another part of the brain telling it, “Whoa, slow down!” Which of those parts of the brain won out depended upon your own history, which itself depended on your prenatal environment, your environment growing up, your culture, and who knows what else? Where in this chain of events, asks Sapolsky, did something intervene between one neuron and the next, and tell you whether to pull the trigger or not? There is no room for such an intervention, though some &lt;i&gt;compatiblists&lt;/i&gt; – those who agree that our brains are purely deterministic but that we have free will anyway – will argue otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In successive sections called “Seconds to minutes before [you pull the trigger],” “Minutes to days before,” “Weeks to years before,” and then “Back to adolescence,” “And childhood,” and so on, Sapolsky details how your history and even your culture’s history determine your actions and decisions. Ever steal something? Maybe not, if you were brought up wealthy. But what if you were brought up poor and had to steal a loaf of bread to survive? In the first case, assuming that you were tempted, the Whoa! part of your brain won out, whereas in the second case the Go! part of your brain won out. In each case, your response was purely biochemical, I am afraid, and the wealthy person who does not steal has nothing in particular to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sapolsky, it is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down&quot;&gt;turtles all the way down&lt;/a&gt; but rather neurons all the way to the beginning, or at least, I suppose, to the evolution of the neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go into a lot more detail would require a booklet, at least. But let me note, for example, that being exposed to a disgusting smell can change your attitudes toward what Sapolsky calls “purity violations.” How can that be? Evidently the processing of stimuli that we consider &lt;i&gt;morally&lt;/i&gt; disgusting has co-opted part of the older brain region for processing &lt;i&gt;physically&lt;/i&gt; disgusting things such as spoiled or rotting food, and there is crosstalk. Experimental subjects will not tell you, “Oh, that disgusting smell influenced my decision to punish that person”; rather, they will tell you that some “recent insight” influenced their decision. Now statistically changing people’s attitudes by exposing them to disgusting smells does not disprove free will, but it goes part way toward making the case, and of course Sapolsky goes into much greater depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky treats us to chapters on chaos, emergence, and quantum mechanics. As briefly as possible, he notes that chaos is actually &lt;i&gt;deterministic&lt;/i&gt; (except possibly for the occasional quantum fluctuation), but not &lt;i&gt;calculable&lt;/i&gt; because we cannot calculate with sufficient precision. He takes to task several thinkers who have tied free will to chaos because they frankly do not understand the difference between being deterministic and being calculable – the weather, for example, is deterministic, but we cannot calculate it beyond a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergent properties are properties which arise in complex systems made up of simple elements, when those simple elements combine in such a way as to create new properties that are not displayed in the simple elements themselves. One water molecule is not wet, but a sufficiently large collection of water molecules displays the property of wetness, and wetness is known as an emergent property. Another example, which Sapolsky particularly likes: certain kinds of ants (which have not the slightest understanding of bridge building and certainly no blueprints) use their bodies to build a bridge in order to span a gap in their path. That bridge is emergent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that free will may be an emergent property of a collection of neurons, then you need to show how free will may emerge. One way you may do so, incorrectly, is by misunderstanding the distinction between deterministic and calculable; see above. Or you may assume, as Sapolsky puts it, that once you have emergent states, they can “do whatever the hell they want.” And finally, you may think that, again in Sapolsky’s words, “… an emergent state can reach down and change the fundamental nature of the [building blocks] comprising it.” It is like saying that, once they have built the bridge, those ants no longer have to behave like ants. If you want more, get the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky says he really did not want to write chapters on quantum indeterminacy. Not only does he not understand quantum indeterminacy; neither does anyone else. His description of the double-slit experiment is pretty good, except where he repeats a very common misconception: when you block one of the slits or attempt to measure which slit the electron passed through, it does not stop behaving like a wave. The double-slit pattern disappears, but we still see the diffraction pattern of a single slit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not – cannot – go into much detail here, but I am firmly in agreement with Sapolsky when he says that if quantum indeterminacy were an important factor in governing our behavior, we would make decisions randomly, and that is not exactly my definition of free will. Mostly, we do not make decisions randomly, so the effect of quantum indeterminacy must obviously be small. Sapolsky explains why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book concerns crime and punishment or, perhaps more accurately, transgression and rehabilitation. Sapolsky asks the question, if everyone believed we had no free will, would we all run amok? I do not know the answer to that question, but I can reasonably assure you that neither Sapolsky nor I have ever run amok, and I daresay that we do not intend to. That said, Sapolsky cites some studies that show that you can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; undermine someone's belief in free will and they feel less of a sense of agency…. And most important for our purposes, they become less ethical in their behavior, less helpful, and more aggressive. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky wittily advises us to “burn this book before anyone else stumbles upon it and has their moral compass on board.” Fortunately, the effect was small, and a meta-analysis showed no consistent effects. Sapolsky searches for evidence that religious people are nicer than atheists and comes up with a statistic that religious people are, for example, more charitable than atheists. I think that statistic is fairly well known, but Sapolsky notes that their charity extends largely to their own group; in other words, they are largely charitable toward themselves. (Indeed, I have looked at my own charitable contributions and find that about 30 % go to my synagogue, though some of that is only temporary. Other monies, which I have not quantified, go to local agencies from which I may benefit. Charity may begin at home, but sometimes it also ends at home.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapolsky pretty well establishes that atheists and those who do not believe in free will are no better or worse than religious people and those who believe in free will. That leaves the question, though, what do free-will deniers recommend that we do with transgressors, if we believe that they do not control their own actions? Punishment seems inappropriate, but they can inflict very real loss or pain. Sapolsky provides a long history showing in detail how much we have improved since the days when we used to draw and quarter people. Also, we have improved since the days when we thought, for example, that schizophrenia was a result of poor mothering, rather than the brain disease we now know it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then to do with transgressors? Quarantine them, the way we quarantine people with various diseases (or should I say non-mental diseases?). When he says quarantine, however, he does not mean jail in the way the US as a practical matter applies the term. To the contrary, he says we must quarantine people in a way that constrains them the least, because in the last analysis their transgressions are not their fault. He points to Norway, where prisoners live in tiny apartments with televisions and various amenities, and yet the recidivism rate is one-quarter that of the US, where people can actually learn to be better criminals in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the book is 400 pages long, not counting notes. I thought it could have been a lot shorter. For example, the author spends a great deal of time on schizophrenia (not to mention drawing and quartering). In the middle of the last century, in the complete absence of evidence and sometimes in defiance of evidence, psychoanalysts blamed schizophrenia on mothers’ parenting. Even when schizophrenia was conclusively demonstrated to be a brain disease and treatable with drugs, psychoanalysts refused to give in. Sapolsky seems angry and heaps a great deal of well-deserved opprobrium – but according to his belief and mine, these mid-century psychoanalysts had no choice but to believe what they believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewer’s last inch. I want to renew my complaint that the Kindle edition, which I may lease but not purchase, at $16.99 costs the same as the paperback and $4.15 less than the hardcover, both of which I may own and do whatever I want with. I read the Kindle edition, and I was less than satisfied with the figures. The book was long and there were many, many endnotes; I sometimes had the impression that the author had unearthed all this material and was, by God, going to get it in one way or another. Even on a Kindle the notes were annoying, and I skipped most of them; I imagine they would have become intolerable if you tried to read them all in the print edition. Finally, though I very much appreciated the informal style and occasional humor, and noticed very few spelling or other errors, I thought the editor should have cut out the more extreme cuss words.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Several weeks ago, in an article entitled Do we have free will?

As the title suggests, I analyze all of the major mathematical arguments put forth by creationists and intelligent design (ID) proponents and find them all to be very poor.  Inevitably, I devote a fair amount of space to William Dembski’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I naturally raised an eyebrow upon hearing that Dembski has now released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Design-Inference-Eliminating-through-Probabilities/dp/1637120346&quot;&gt; revised and expanded edition&lt;/a&gt; of his 1998 book &lt;i&gt;The Design Inference&lt;/i&gt;, now coauthored with Winston Ewert.  I wondered if he would have anything worthwhile to say in response to my book, and it was gratifying to see that my name shows up numerous times in the index.  I will look forward to seeing what he has to say, once I have acquired a copy of the book.  However, Dembski has &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2023/11/an-argument-from-ignorance/&quot;&gt;posted an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from the book’s Introduction, and I was delighted to see that, perhaps inadvertently, he has simply conceded two of the main points I raised against his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that Dembski’s catchphrase is “complex, specified information.”  Roughly, this means that if something has a low probability of arising by chance and instantiates an independently describable pattern, then intelligent design is implicated at some point in its causal history.  In my book, I argued that, to the extent that he intends to apply this to biological structures, he has no hope of establishing either complexity or specificity.  We have nothing like the information we need to carry out a meaningful probability calculation, and we have no background information relevant to distinguishing design-suggesting patterns from those we simply impose on nature (like seeing a dragon in a fluffy, cumulus cloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I noted that when Dembski calculates the probability of something like a flagellum, he explicitly assumes that an “irreducibly complex” (IC) system cannot evolve by gradual means.  This means his argument is completely parasitic on Michael Behe’s claims about IC systems: If those claims are correct, then they are all by themselves a strong argument against evolution.  A probability calculation adds nothing.  But since those claims are completely wrong, no calculation based on them will have any meaning.  For specification, I noted that Dembski presents an elaborate mathematical apparatus, complete with notation, jargon, and Greek letters, which is meant to allow us to distinguish real patterns from artificial ones.  But then he never uses that machinery for anything, but instead just says that biological structures are obviously specified by their function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that set-up, here is Dembski from his Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tacitly in the first edition of &lt;i&gt;The Design Inference&lt;/i&gt; and explicitly in its sequel, &lt;i&gt;No Free Lunch&lt;/i&gt;, I argued that natural selection and random variation could not create the sort of complexity we see in living things.  My approach in applying the design inference to biology was to piggyback on the work of design biologists Douglas Axe and Michael Behe.  They had identified certain subcellular systems . . . that proved highly resistant to Darwinian explanations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely my point!  “Piggyback” is a more polite term than “parasitic,” but my term is more accurate.  It is the claims made by Behe and Axe that are doing all the work in the argument that evolution as currently understood is seriously deficient.  Dembski’s calculations are irrelevant, in addition to being incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the last quote, Dembski writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our joint task was to put plausible numbers to these systems so that even factoring in Darwinian natural selection, the probability of those systems arising was exceedingly small.  Note that the specification of these systems, as in their exhibiting the right sort of a pattern for a design inference, was never in question.  The issue was always whether the probabilities were small enough.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski’s calculations do not, in even the slightest way, “factor in” Darwinian natural selection.  Instead, they use certain claims made by Behe and Axe to justify ignoring natural selection altogether.  Once again, it is those claims, and not Dembski’s pointless calculations, that are doing all the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, note how dismissive he is of establishing “specificity” in his idiosyncratic sense.  This, again, was precisely my point.  Dembski and his supporters tell the world he has a mathematically rigorous way of distinguishing real patterns from artificial ones.  But that mathematical machinery plays no role at all in his actual argument that the flagellum, say, is specified.  Apparently, to specify a flagellum it is sufficient to say, “Kinda looks like an outboard motor.”  Nothing rigorous about it.  And since biologists argue that natural selection crafts functional systems as a matter of course, I would say the question of specificity is very much in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this excerpt is representative of the rest of the book, then I do not think his critics have anything to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish with an extended analogy.  Suppose someone tells you they drew five cards from a shuffled deck and that all were the same suit.  He asks you to work out the probability of that happening.  No problem, that is a basic calculation.  But then he gives you a plot twist.  He tells you that his deck has millions of cards and dozens of suits, and that he will not be any more specific than that.  At this point you laugh and say you need more information to find the probability, thinking that you had just stated the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now an ID proponent charges into the room.  He says, “Of course you can work out the probability.  Just assume there are exactly one million cards and forty suits, with the same number of cards in each suit.”  He then scribbles down elaborate calculations involving factorials and binomial coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astonished that anyone would seriously put forth such a thing, you reply that his calculation is silly since it is based on entirely arbitrary assumptions.  But he just ignores you and says, “And not only is this improbable, but it’s also specified!  I mean, seriously, five cards of the same suit.  What an obvious pattern!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you are face-palming and rolling your eyes.  You point out that since we know nothing about the distribution of suits in this deck, we have no idea if it is remarkable to get five cards of the same suit.  You say, “For all we know one suit is so overrepresented in the deck that getting five of the same suit is close to inevitable.”  Again, you are surprised you need to point this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the ID proponent is undaunted.  He shouts, “You’re just a dogmatic, anti-religious tool of the scientific mafia.”  Then he runs out of the room and writes books telling the world about how he has revolutionized mathematics, biology, and philosophy.  His sycophants start calling him the Isaac Newton of information theory.  Meanwhile, you are left wondering what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End scene.  I think that captures the frustration scientists feel when addressing ID proponents.  Except that there is one point where my analogy does not go far enough: In the analogy, the assumptions underlying the calculation were merely unjustified.  In Dembski’s writing, the assumptions are plainly false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski packs an astonishing amount of error into such a short excerpt, and there is much more to comment on than what I have presented here.  But we will save that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason Rosenhouse</name></author><summary type="html">Last year, I published a book called The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism with Cambridge University Press.
