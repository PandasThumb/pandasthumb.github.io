&lt;p&gt;The ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/01/David-Hillis-on-Ernst-Mayr.html&quot;&gt;controversy over the proposal to de-name the Ernst Mayr Award at the Society for Systematic Biology&lt;/a&gt; is one of many examples of the ongoing re-examination of the history of evolutionary biology with respect to racism in the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have developed many worries about the way that the evaluation of major historical figures in evolutionary biology has been occurring. (I know that the SSB proposal formally tries to avoid having this discussion about Mayr, but evaluating the legacy of a historical figure is simply an unavoidable feature of people reaching a decision about naming/de-naming that historical figure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my main worries are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twitter-neutics: The Twitter hermenutic.&lt;/b&gt; I have noticed in recent years that the common hermeneutic for discussing these issues is basically trial-by-Twitter, where sentences from decades and centuries past are ripped from their original context (sometimes originally taken from creationist quote-mines) and read as if they were modern Twitter posts. This boldly assumes that the quote should be read as if the writer had access to all of the modern scientific knowledge and ethical development that occurred in the years since the passage was written.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paper-denialism.&lt;/b&gt; Another feature of trial-by-Twitter is the principle &quot;If it's not freely online and text-searchable by google, it doesn't exist.&quot; This problem is made worse in the age of the pandemic, where academics are (a) harried and juggling families and work, let alone side-projects, and (b) often locked out of their offices and university libraries.  It is especially problematic when the views of historical figures are being considered, as much of their key work on &quot;public interest&quot; topics like race is in old paper books, old magazines and pamphlets, etc., that are typically not online, and sometimes only available via old-fashioned interlibrary loan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Historians-schmistorians.&lt;/b&gt; For similar reasons, historians of science are rarely consulted. This is despite the fact that the history of scientific racism (and eugenics, a closely related but non-identical topic) is one of the most prolific cottage industries in history of science. Even getting on top of the secondary historical literature in this area is a massive task. (That said, the best single resource I have found on this topic is: Elazar Barkan (1992). &lt;i&gt;The Retreat of Scientific Racism: Changing Concepts of Race in Britain and the United States between the World Wars&lt;/i&gt;. Cambridge University Press. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511558351&quot;&gt;official link if you have library access&lt;/a&gt;, and googling may turn up other PDFs.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main worrying thing I see in online discussions of evolutionary biologists and racism is &lt;b&gt;a major lack of awareness of The Historical Big Picture,&lt;/b&gt; which is that evolutionary biologists, especially and specifically (a) Darwin/T.H. Huxley and (b) the architects of the Modern Synthesis, have been some of the crucial individuals who helped destroy key pillars of scientific racism, and (slowly and painfully) brought academia and society along with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin and Huxley, for instance, basically destroyed polygenism once and for all, and established the overwhelming similarity and close kinship of all modern humans, opposing the view that various extant races were transitional forms. They also vocally opposed slavery, supported the Jamaica Committee, endorsed equal rights and voting rights, etc. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/11/updated-creationists-social-justice-advocates-unite-take-down-huxley.html&quot;&gt;I covered this in detail for T.H. Huxley, here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the Modern Synthesis versus racism, writing it all up is more than I have bandwidth for, but read Barkan’s (1992) &lt;i&gt;The Retreat of Scientific Racism&lt;/i&gt;. The short version is that the key individuals in the U.K. were people like Julian Huxley (T.H. Huxley’s grandson; another grandson was Aldous Huxley, author of &lt;i&gt;Brave New World&lt;/i&gt;), who long before he wrote his 1942 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.280031&quot;&gt;Evolution: The Modern Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, lead-authored the 1935 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rr2c6azf&quot;&gt;We Europeans: a survey of ‘racial’ problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  This was one of the first and most important major debunkings of “race science.” Huxley was encouraged and supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/11/haldane-1938-biology-of-inequality.html&quot;&gt;J.B.S. Haldane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot_Hogben&quot;&gt;Lancelot Hobgen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Singer&quot;&gt;Charles Singer&lt;/a&gt; (the latter is essentially an unacknowledged coauthor of &lt;i&gt;We Europeans&lt;/i&gt;; his name was left off to avoid the charge of the book being Jewish propaganda).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the USA, the key nexus was Columbia University in New York City, where the anthropologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas&quot;&gt;Franz Boas&lt;/a&gt; and his students (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict&quot;&gt;Ruth Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melville_J._Herskovits&quot;&gt;Melville J. Herskovits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2020/07/24/alfred-kroeber-and-his-relations-with-california-indians/&quot;&gt;Alfred L. Kroeber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead&quot;&gt;Margaret Mead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Montagu&quot;&gt;Ashley Montagu&lt;/a&gt;) waged a long public campaign against racism, joined most notably by Theodosius Dobzhansky (originally a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan&quot;&gt;T.H. Morgan&lt;/a&gt;’s “fly-room” at Columbia) and his colleague, Columbia geneticist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._C._Dunn&quot;&gt;Leslie Clarence Dunn&lt;/a&gt;. Dobzhansky wrote books and articles against racism for decades (see e.g. Dunn &amp;amp; Dobzhansky, 1947, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcomecollection.org/works/akf3dnfs&quot;&gt;Heredity, Race, and Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).  Reviewing Dobzhansky’s work in this area will have to wait for when The Great Iconoclasm of the 2020s comes for him (give it a few weeks!).  I do include a few quotes from Dobzhansky below, as clearly Dobzhansky helped inspire Mayr’s anti-racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to Ernst Mayr: Mayr and Dobzhansky were probably &lt;b&gt;the two biggest boosters of the idea that population genetic thinking destroyed the typological concept of race, and thus undermined the basic foundation of racism.&lt;/b&gt;  For them, races were pretty arbitrary divisions of a continuously mixing gene pool, the differences between individuals within each “race” were far greater than any between them, and individual variation meant there was no such thing as a “typical” member of a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Mayr is on the radar, I thought it would be worthwhile to quote him through the decades on the issue of race. Although we can see some features indicating that he was clearly a person of his time (for example, the then-conventional use of “Man” for “humankind” throughout), including a few vestiges of older views on race, on the whole I found it surprising just how much of Mayr is now just conventional wisdom, so thoroughly embedded in all of our heads that we moderns don’t even think about how these views were promoted and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is hazardous for us moderns to judge historical figures if we don’t even realize how much of our modern worldview was built by those same figures. Hopefully, posting these quotes, for reading and google-ability, will help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

Chapter 4: Selection, p. 77:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Concept of Adaptive Value&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is well known that Darwin's conception of natural selection was derived from the idea of Malthus, that even the slowest breeding organisms tend to produce more offspring that [sic] can survive without eventually outrunning the food supply. Death and destruction of a part of the progeny undoubtedly take place in all organisms. It was the differential mortality of the carriers of different genotypes composing a population that was supposed to make selection effective. Unfortunately, this process was also described by metaphors which were more picturesque than accurate, such as &quot;struggle for life&quot; and &quot;the survival of the fittest.&quot; Natural selection became associated in too many minds with emotional slogans like &quot;eat or be eaten,&quot; and this led to misuse of Darwinism by propagandists and bigots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
p. 140&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People with O and with A blood groups are not distinct races, because they do not form different populations, although different populations often differ in the incidence of these blood groups. Similarly, people with long and with short heads, or slender and fat people, are not races. Calling them races leads to the absurd situations when brothers and sisters would differ in race from each other and from their parents.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr also hopes that &quot;the authoritative Statement prepared by Unesco will help to eliminate the pseudoscientific race conceptions which have been used as excuses for many injustices and even shocking crimes&quot;. &quot;I applaud and wholeheartedly endorse [it],&quot; he writes, adding: &lt;b&gt;&quot;It cannot be emphasized too strongly that all so-called races are variable populations, and that there is often more difference between extreme individuals of one race than between certain individuals of different races. All human races are mixtures of populations and the term &quot;pure race&quot; is an absurdity. The second important point which needs stressing is that genetics plays a very minor part in the cultural characteristics of different peoples&lt;/b&gt;....The third point is that equality of opportunity and equality in law do not depend on physical, intellectual and genetic identity. There are striking differences in physical, intellectual and other genetically founded qualities among individuals of even the most homogeneous human population, even among brothers and sisters. No acknowledged ethical principle exists which would permit denial of equal opportunity for reason of such differences to any member of the human species.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;[Himmelfarb's] discussion of Darwin's relation to teleological thinking fails to penetrate to the core of the issue. Neither she nor the majority of philosophers seem to realize that the &quot;Why?&quot; that Darwin asks so often is not the teleological &quot;What for?&quot; but the scientific &quot;How come?&quot; The investigator who asks, &quot;Why are there tides in the ocean?,&quot; is inquiring into their causation . The anti-teleological impact of this kind of &quot;Why?,&quot; correctly emphasized by John Dewey, is missed by Dr. Himmelfarb entirely when she calls Darwin's questioning a &quot;preeminently teleological inquiry.&quot; No wonder she is puzzled &quot;that Darwin, the least philosophical of men, should have fastened upon that most philosophical and metaphysical of all questions [and yet that] his questions, while fundamental, were never abstract.&quot; The reason is that Darwin was intensely interested in ultimate causes, but never in &quot;final&quot; causes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One might claim that these errors are irrelevant in a book primarily concerned with the Darwinian revolution, the impact of Darwin on the contemporary scene. But even here I feel that Dr. Himmelfarb has not done Darwin justice. She describes quite correctly how bewildered Darwin was about the social and ethical applications of Darwinism.&lt;b&gt; He certainly would not have excused war, class struggle, robber baronism and racism as logical consequences of Darwinism. Yet she nowhere points out that it is totally unjustifiable to interpret such things in terms of Darwinism.&lt;/b&gt; It does not matter which of Darwin's basic principles one takes: the population principle or the principle of the biological contribution to the next generation (the true touchstone of natural selection); applying either of these principles to &quot;social Darwinism&quot; shows that they are in complete opposition to it. The adoption of pseudo-Darwinism by all-or-nothing philosophers, by typologists and by others unable to think statistically has led to all sorts of monstrous ideologies that no true Darwinian could ever have conceived. It is the term &quot;struggle,&quot; which Darwin so unfortunately took over from Thomas Malthus and Lyell, that seems to have given misinformed laymen the idea that physical struggle was the basic principle of Darwinism.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
[summarizing &lt;b&gt;Chapter 12: The Polytypic Species of the Taxonomist&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The term &quot;species&quot; is as useful in purely taxonomic as in evolutionary studies of animals. On the infraspecific level a slight dualism is unavoidable, without calling, however, for an elaborate new terminology. The application of the word &quot;subspecies&quot; is best restricted to taxonomy, while terms like &quot;deme,&quot; &quot;race,&quot; &quot;geographic isolate,&quot; and &quot;cline&quot; belong to the field of evolutionary biology. Finally, terms like &quot;variety&quot; and &quot;biological race&quot; have been such catchalls for heterogenous phenomena that they would better be discarded altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[Chapter 20: Man as a Biological Species]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
643&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Polytypic Species &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All the different kinds of living man on the face of the earth belong to a single species. They form a single set of intercommunicating gene pools. As a matter of fact, the various races of man are less different from each other than are the subspecies of many polytypic species of animals. Yet a few misguided individuals have applied a type of typological species definition to man and have divided him into five or six separate species by using such artificial criteria as white, yellow, red, or black skin color. Such a division not only leaves a considerable portion of mankind unclassified as intermediates or relic primitives, but also is completely contrary to the biological species concept (Chapters 2 and 12). There are no genetic isolating mechanisms separating any of the races of mankind, and even the social barriers function inefficiently where different races come into contact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is often asked whether man is in the process of speciating and whether the races of man should be considered incipient species. In attempting to answer this question one must recall that the hominids occupy one of the most spectacularly distinctive adaptive zones on earth. In the animal kingdom the invasion of a new adaptive zone usually results in a burst of adaptive radiation into various subniches. This has not happened in the history of the family Hominidae. Mayr (1950a) has pointed out that this failure of man to species is due to two causes: &quot;It seems to me that [one] reason is man's great ecological diversity. Man has, so to speak, specialized in despecialization. Man occupies more different ecological niches than any known animal. If the single species man occupies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
644&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
successfully all the niches that are open for &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;-like creatures, it is obvious that he cannot speciate.&quot; The second reason is that isolating mechanism in hominids apparently develop only slowly. There have been many isolates in the polytypic species &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; and in the species ancestral to it, but isolation never lasted sufficiently long for isolating mechanisms to become perfected. Man's great mobility and independence of the environment have made perfect geographic isolation impossible. As a consequence all parts of the globe, including all climatic zones, are now occupied by a single species. What other species of animal includes populations adapted to the Arctic as well as to the tropics, and ranging from almost pure vegetarians to almost pure carnivores? The probability of man's breaking up into several species has become smaller and smaller with the steady improvement of communication and means of transport. The internal cohesion of the genetic system of man is being strengthened constantly.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Races of Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no agreement yet on the formal classification of the subdivisions of &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;. Of two highly competent treatises on the races of man, both published in 1950, one (Boyd 1950) recognizes 6 races, the other (Coon &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; 1950) recognizes 30. Both classifications are equally legitimate. Yet even the division into 30 races is by no means exhaustive. Race number 9 (&quot;Negrito&quot;), of Coon &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; lumps together numerous relict populations from the Congo in Africa and from southeast Asia, the Phillipines, and New Guinea, populations that (if they are related at all) are less closely related than are the four European races recognized by these authors. The same is true, to a lesser extent, of nearly all the other races. All are collective groupings of more or less differentiated local populations. Even Lundman's recognition (1952) of 37 races and some 30 additional subraces contains several heterogenous groupings. And yet this is only one of the difficulties. All these are contemporary races of Recent Man. If we go back in history we find chronological subdivisions of Homo sapiens such as, let us say, Cro-Magnon Man or more differentiated Neanderthal and finally the Steinheim-Swanscombe Man, the earliest &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; that cannot clearly be separated from the polytypic species &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;. Biologically, it is immaterial how many subspecies and races of man one wants to recognize. The essential point is to recognize the genetic and biological continuity of all these gene pools, localized in space and time, and to recognize the biological meaning of their adaptations and specializations. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[646]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Amount of Difference Among Human Races&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is relatively easy to describe the differences among human races in terms of dimensions, proportions, pigmentation, hair shape, and other morphological characters. Yet the question is raised again and again: just how meaningful are such morphological data? First of all, they have only a partial genetic basis since, as is well known, pigmentation may depend on exposure to sun and size on nutrition. More serious is the objection that neither size nor pigmentation is a critical human characteristic. The critical characteristics are intelligence, inventiveness, imagination, compassion, and other traits that are difficult to measure and to compare. As stated above, the extreme viewpoint has been to deny that such differences among humans exist. A more conservative view would be to assume that as a consequence of manifold genetic differences among human populations there will be average differences for any kind of trait that has at least in part a genetic basis. All attempts to separate genetic and nongenetic characters (or contributions to the characters) have until now been quite unsuccessful. So far as I know, there is not one single mental trait for which a clear-cut racial different has been established, in spite of high probability that such differences exist. Twin studies are so far the only reliable proof of the partial genetic determination of mental traits. This much is certain, however, that the differences between individuals of a single population or race are usually larger than those between populations or races.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Population Concept in Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As in biology, the outstanding conceptual revolution that has occurred in physical anthropology is the replacement of typological thinking by population thinking. This shift has affected every concept in anthropology, although none as strongly as the race concept. &lt;b&gt;The typological race concept of the racists is something thoroughly odious;&lt;/b&gt; the statistically defined race of the botanist and zoologist is a fact of nature. The basis for race formation is the same for all sexually reproducing organisms and consists in the fact that no two individuals are identical nor are any two local populations. No individual can therefore be &quot;typical&quot; of a race. Indeed, in polymorphic races different individuals may be strikingly different. [647] To look for and speak of &quot;pure races&quot; is sheer nonsense. Variability is inherent in any natural population and is favored by natural selection on account of the frequent superiority of heterozygotes and the diversity of the environment (Chapters 9 and 10). What differs from race to race is the degree of variability and this depends on the size of the populations, the variability of the habitat, and other factors discussed in previous chapters. Much of the phenotypic variability of mankind is presumably due to the occasional production of homozygotes by heterozygous parents. This is particularly true of constitutional extremes, individuals that are exceptionally large, small, obese, or thin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are other reasons for man's phenotypic variability. Man is a restless creature and since prehistoric times he has made large-scale migrations. The numerous colonizations of America by Asiatic tribes, the conquest of the South Seas by the Polynesians, the great Bantu migrations, and the massive movements of Slavic and Germanic tribes in the dying days of the Roman Empire are only a few spectacular examples. Conquerors almost invariably absorb part of the defeated tribe or nation or are absorbed by it. On this basis one might expect man to have exceptionally high individual variability, but this is not the case. Schultz (1944, 1947) has shown that some of the anthropoids far exceed man in this respect, as do many other animals. Some human populations that are clearly the product of hybridization do not seem to have signficantly higher variability than have unmixed races (Trevor 1953).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
649&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Claims of human identity [Mayr means the concept that all humans are identical, which he contrasts with the concept of moral/legal equality] are the outcome of typological thinking, of a belief that within the human type there is &quot;no essential variation.&quot; &lt;b&gt;Political theorizers have invariably applied such typological formulas when trying to resolve the difficulties posed by man's variability. The racism of the Nazis, for instance, was an outcome of such thinking. They rigidly defined each race by absolute characteristics: the &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; race &quot;is lazy,&quot; the &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; race is &quot;of great intelligence,&quot; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; race is &quot;musical,&quot; and, worst of all, the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; race is &quot;superior.&quot; This allowed neither for the fact that many of the characteristics mentioned have only a partial (often a very small) genetic component, nor for the fact that many members of the various races do not have these characteristics at all.&lt;/b&gt; Another fallacy of typological racism is that it claims perfect correlation between the various characteristics ascribed to each race. Accordingly it claims an association between a particular color of the eyes or the hair and certain traits of the [650] mind or the character. Actually, all available evidence negates the existence of such absolute correlations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every politician, clergyman, educator, or physician, in short, anyone dealing with human individuals, is bound to make grave mistakes if he ignores these two great truths of population zoology: (1) no two individuals are alike, and (2) both environment and genetic endowment make a contribution to nearly every trait.

Nothing has delayed a modern approach to the study of man more than antiquated ideologies and meaningless controversies. Nature versus nurture, instinct versus learning, race versus biological identity, equality versus biological identity all such antitheses have provoked arguments that have long been shown by biologists to be meaningless, yet much political argument and indecision in public policy is due to the painful lag between scientific recognition and public understanding. This is why a scientifically sound volume on man such as Dobzhansky's is of such extraordinary importance. It admirably fulfills two functions: it presents that which we know, and, perhaps more importantly, it demolishes a considerable number of harmful misconceptions.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Appreciating the grave danger of various misconceptions such as that of the master race, the nongenetic aspects of nonphysical characteristics, the concept of the tabula rasa of some psychologists, etc., Dobzhansky devotes much space to their refutation.&lt;/b&gt; The idea that modern man is no longer subject to natural selection is shown to be false. There is, however, a difference between primitive and modern man: the mortality differential of selection has been replaced by a fertility differential. Here the author could have perhaps stressed even more clearly that so-called Darwinian fitness consists of two drastically different components: genuine adaptive fitness and mere reproductive advantage. Dobzhansky's discussion of equality versus identity is particularly clear and constructive. &quot;The notion that all men are born...biologically alike, is a fallacy...pernicious in the long run.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No other issue has beclouded the study of man as much as the continuing controversy between environmentalists and hereditarians. Dobzhansky does a great service by presenting much of the history of this controversy and an anthology of some of the more extreme claims. The issue is now theoretically resolved, since no intelligent student questions that man is a product both of his nature and of his environment (which includes his cultural history). &lt;b&gt;Lysenkoism is as wrong as is racism, yet we are still far from being able to partition our phenotype into the contributions made by heredity and those&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[p. 244]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;made by the environment. It is obviously impossible to investigate man as we do animals, since neither controlled breeding nor raising in artificial environments is available as a method of analysis.&lt;/b&gt; Correlation tests among twins and other relatives, which are increasingly being refined and extended by human geneticists, are beginning to give accurate estimates. Dobzhansky presents, in Chapter 4, much of the evidence that now exists for a genetic contribution not only to intelligence but also to many other human traits. Since personality traits affect susceptibility to criminality, addiction to smoking, and other social characteristics, it is not surprising that greater concordance for some of these traits is found among identical than among fraternal twins. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These findings are still heatedly denied by some authors whose typological thinking forces them into a rigid determinism in which human fate is as inevitable as in a Greek tragedy. Many facts, such as the experience that identical twins do not necessarily behave in an identical manner, disprove the deterministic approach and open the gate to researches on methods for coping with an adverse genetic endowment. This is a far more constructive approach than the ostrich policy of denying the importance of the genotype.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Man behaves in this respect differently from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Contrary to what racists so stridently proclaim, there is not a detectable trace of a loss of fitness in either the F1 or in later generations of hybrids between even the most distinctive human races.&lt;/b&gt; Nor is there any evidence of heterosis in the F1.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The genetic consequences of migration are worth more thought and study than they have thus far received. What happens when a race of a polytypic species improves its adaptedness and spreads to the areas of other races? There is no need to ascribe to our remote ancestors a degree of ferocity attained by only some of their descendants; the invaders need not have slaughtered the entire populations of the territories invaded. Genocide is less probable than genosorption, i.e., incorporation of genes of one population into the gene pool of another. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This article was concluded and sent to the publisher before the appearance of The Origin of Races by C. S. Coon. Dr. Coon and I are in agreement that the now living polytypic species, &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, is descended from the single polytypic Homo erectus of the mid-Pleistocene. Dr. Coon has, however, chosen to believe that &lt;i&gt;H. erectus&lt;/i&gt; was transformed into H. sapiens not once but five times, and that this transformation occurred much earlier in some places than in others. &lt;b&gt;This belief, which has made Dr. Coon's work attractive to racist pamphleteers, is neither supported by conclusive evidence nor plausible on theoretical grounds. The specific unity of mankind was maintained throughout its history by gene flow&lt;/b&gt; due to migration and the process for which the word &quot;genosorption&quot; is suggested above. Excepting through such gene flow, repeated origins of the same species are so improbable that this conjecture is not worthy of serious consideration; and given a gene flow, it becomes fallacious to say that a species has originated repeatedly, and even more fallacious to contend that it has originated five times, or any other number above one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many new concepts arose out of this work of the taxonomist but have since diffused broadly into genetics, ecology, physiology, and other areas of biology. By far the most important of these, as I have often stressed in the past, is population thinking. Biology, as all other sciences, was permeated by typological thinking until late in the 19th century, and is still today.  &lt;b&gt;When the learning psychologist speaks of The Rat or The Monkey, or the racist of The Negro, this is typological thinking.&lt;/b&gt; The early Mendelians were pure typologists. A mutation changed The Wildtype, and the result was a new type of organism, according to De Vries a new species. I have pointed out elsewhere (4) that taxonomists began as early as the 1840's and the 1850's to collect large series of individuals, population samples as we would now say, and describe the variation in those samples. From this purely pragmatic operation emerged eventually a whole new way of thinking which replaced typological essentialism. From taxonomy, population thinking spread into adjacent fields and was in part instrumental in the development of population genetics and population cytology. This one conceptual contribution alone has been of such great benefit to vast areas of biology as to justify support for systematics.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Population Thinking versus Essentialism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Western thinking for more than two thousand years after Plato was
dominated by essentialism. It was not until the nineteenth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
46&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
century that a new and different way of thinking about nature began to spread,
so-called population thinking. What is population thinking and how does it
differ from essentialism? Population thinkers stress the uniqueness of
everything in the organic world. What is important for them is the individual,
not the type. They emphasize that every individual in sexually reproducing
species is uniquely different from all others, with much individuality even
existing in uniparentally reproducing ones. There is no &quot;typical&quot; individual,
and mean values are abstractions. Much of what in the past has been
designated in biology as &quot;classes&quot; are populations consisting of unique
individuals (Ghiselin, 1974b; Hull, 1976).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a potential for population thinking in Leibniz's theory of
monads, for Leibniz postulated that each monad was individualistically
different from every other monad, a major departure from essentialism. But
essentialism had such a strong hold in Germany that Leibniz's suggestion did
not result in any population thinking. When it finally developed elsewhere, it
had two roots; one consisted of the British animal breeders (Bakewell,
Sebright, and many others) who had come to realize that every individual in
their herds had different heritable characteristics, on the basis of which they
selected the sires and dams of the next generation. The other root was
systematics. All practicing naturalists were struck by the observation that
when collecting a &quot;series&quot; of specimens of a single species they found that no
two specimens were ever completely alike. Not only did Darwin stress this in
his barnacle work, but even Darwin's critics concurred on this point.
Wollaston (1860), for instance, wrote &quot;amongst the millions of people who
have been born into the world, we are certain that no two have ever been
precisely alike in every respect; and in a similar manner it is not too much to
affirm the same of all living creatures (however alike some of them may seem
to our uneducated eyes) that have ever existed.&quot; Similar statements were made
by many mid-nineteenth-century taxonomists. This uniqueness is true not only
for individuals but even for stages in the life cycle of any individual, and for
aggregations of individuals whether they be demes, species, or plant and
animal associations. Considering the large number of genes that are either
turned on or turned off in a given cell, it is quite possible that not even any two
cells in the body are completely identical. This uniqueness of biological
individuals means that we must approach groups of biological entities in a
very different spirit from the way we deal with groups of identical inorganic
entities. This is the basic meaning of population&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
47&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
thinking. The differences between biological individuals are real, while
the mean values which we may calculate in the comparison of groups of
individuals (species, for example) are manmade inferences. This fundamental
difference between the classes of the physical scientists and the populations of
the biologists has various consequences. For instance, he who does not
understand the uniqueness of individuals is unable to understand the working
of natural selection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The statistics of the essentialist are quite different from those of the populationist. When we measure a physical constant -- for instance, the speed of light -- we know that under equivalent circumstances it is constant and that any variation in the observational results is due to inaccuracy of measurement, the statistics simply indicating the degree of reliability of our results. The early statistics from Petty and Graunt to Quetelet (Hilts, 1973) was essentialistic statistics, attempting to arrive at true values in order to overcome the confusing effects of variation. Quetelet, a follower of Laplace, was interested in deterministic laws. He hoped by his method to be able to calculate the characteristics of the &quot;average man,&quot; that is, to discover the &quot;essence&quot; of man. Variation was nothing but &quot;errors&quot; around the mean values.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Francis Galton was perhaps the first to realize fully that the mean value of variable biological populations is a construct. Differences in height among a group of people are real and not the result of inaccuracies of measurement. The most interesting parameter in the statistics of natural populations is the actual variation, its amount, and its nature. The amount of variation is different from character to character and from species to species. Darwin could not have arrived at a theory of natural selection if he had not adopted populational thinking. The sweeping statements in the racist literature, on the other hand, are almost invariably based on essentialistic (typological) thinking.&lt;b&gt;The sweeping statements in the racist literature, on the other hand, are almost invariably based on essentialistic (typological) thinking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
523-524&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ideological Resistance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Inevitably, the concept of natural selection was eventually applied to
man. This resulted in various excesses (such as racism)&lt;/b&gt; but also in the counter
claim that an assumption of genetic differences of selective significance in
man was in conflict with the principle of equality. Extreme egalitarianism led
to the development of strongly environmentalist schools, particularly in
American anthropology and in behaviorist psychology. As noble as these
movements were in their basic ideology, and perhaps as necessary as they
were to combat racism and social prejudice, the major claims of these schools
were not substantiated by any concrete evidence but were based on an unbiological concept of equality. The situation
was made worse when Lysenkoism raised its ugly head in the USSR and when
certain Marxist groups in the western countries decided to attack genetics and
to promote environmentalism. Some of the attacks against sociobiology in
recent years originated from the same ideology. Linking Darwin's name with
Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism was also detrimental for the acceptability
of natural selection (Freeman, 1974; Nichols, 1974; Hertwig, 1921; Greene,
1977; Bannister, 1979).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


623&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Eugenics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recognition that natural selection, and natural selection alone, had raised man from the level of an ape to that of a human being suggested to Galton soon after Darwin's death that one might apply this principle of selection in order to achieve a biological improvement of man. This utopian scheme, to which he gave the name eugenics, found at first many adherents. In fact, a large number of geneticists and other biologists agreed in their writings that it was a noble idea to improve mankind by facilitating the reproduction of the &quot;best&quot; members of the species and by preventing the reproduction of individuals who had genetic diseases or were otherwise inferior. Actually, two kinds of eugenics must be distinguished. Negative eugenics endeavors to reduce the number of deleterious genes in a population by preventing the reproduction of carriers of dominant genes and by reducing the reproductive rate of heterozygous carriers of recessives (where such heterozygotes can be diagnosed). Positive eugenics strives to enhance the reproductive capacity of &quot;superior&quot; individuals (Haller, 1963; Osborn, 1968). When one reads the writings of these early believers in eugenics, one is impressed by their idealism and humanity. They saw in eugenics a means to go beyond the improvements made possible by education and a rise in the standard of living. No political bias was at first attached to eugenics, and it was supported by the entire range of opinion from the far left to the far right. But this did not last long. &lt;b&gt;Eugenics soon became a tool of racists and of reactionaries. Instead of being applied strictly to population thinking, it was interpreted typologically; soon, without the show of any evidence, whole races of mankind were designated as superior or inferior. In the long run it led to the horrors of Hitler's holocaust.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a consequence it has become almost impossible, since 1933, to discuss eugenics objectively. This does not invalidate the fact, however, that it was through natural selection that man reached humanity, and it is equally true that we know of no method other than selection to improve the human genotype. Nevertheless, to apply artificial selection to man is impossible, at least for the time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
624&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
being, for a number of reasons. The first one is that it is quite unknown to what extent nonphysical human characteristics have a genetic basis. Second, human society thrives on the diversity of talents and capabilities of its members; even if we had the ability to manage the selection, we would not have any idea for what particular mixture of talents we should strive. Finally, the concept that people are genetically different, even were it scientifically even better established than it is today, is not acceptable to the majority of western people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

634&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is only a small sample of widely held misconceptions concerning inheritance. Inheritance, being such a conspicuous phenomenon, became the subject of a diversified folklore-&quot;science,&quot; the remnants of which can be found among laypersons even today. &lt;b&gt;Animal breeders, for instance, insisted that if a female of a pure race had once been inseminated by a male of a different race or by a mongrel, her &quot;blood&quot; would be permanently impure so that she could no longer be used for breeding purposes. This belief often was also applied to mankind, particularly in the racist literature.&lt;/b&gt; It was also widely believed that a single offspring could be fathered by several males so that a child of a female who had received several males in the period during which she had conceived would combine the characteristics of these several fathers. There was also the belief in a great plasticity of the genetic material; for example, it was believed that any accidents of the mother, like being frightened by a snake, might affect the fetus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
4. Several authors, more or less independently, recognized the importance of Darwin's shift from competition among species to competition among individuals: Vorzimmer (1969), Herbert (1971), Ghiselin (1969; 1971-72). &lt;b&gt;The lesson that Darwin's struggle for existence is a reproductive competition among individuals was, alas, not understood at all by most of those who subsequently operated most freely with the struggle for existence, particularly racists and adherents of so-called social Darwinism (or more correctly, social Spencerism).&lt;/b&gt; This is true, for instance, for most authors cited by Greene (1977), but occasionally even Darwin expressed himself ambiguously (Greene 1981).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;All racist theories are built on this [typology] foundation. &lt;/b&gt; Essentially, it asserts that every representative of a race conforms to the type and is separated from the representatives of any other race by a distinct gap.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Population thinking is a major and very beneficial contribution made by Darwin. For instance, it completely refutes the typological aspects of racism.&lt;/b&gt; One can no longer make typological statements based on mean values of human population groups because we now know that every individual is different from every other individual, not only of other races, but even of his own race. Unfortunately, in our educational system and in other aspects of our culture, we are still tending to think too typologically, and do not allow sufficiently for the unique differences among individuals. This heritage from Darwin has not yet been fully adopted by our culture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

27&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Typological thinking, therefore, is unable to accommodate variation and has given rise to a misleading conception of human races. Caucasians, Africans, Asians, and Inuits are types for a typologist that differ conspicuously from other human ethnic groups and are sharply separated from them. &lt;b&gt;This mode of thinking leads to racism. Darwin completely rejected typological thinking and instead used an entirely different concept, now called &lt;i&gt;population thinking&lt;/i&gt; (see below).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
89&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Population thinking is of tremendous importance in daily life. &lt;b&gt;For instance, the failure to apply population thinking is the major source of racism.&lt;/b&gt; Many of Darwin's associates, such as Charles Lyell and T.H. Huxley (Mayr 1982), never adopted population thinking and remained typologists all their lives. Consequently they were unable to understand and accept natural selection. Typological thinking was so firmly rooted in the thinking of the period that it is not surprising it took eighty years until, in the 1930s, the concept of natural selection was finally universally adopted by evolutionists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

pp. 166-167:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The situation is somewhat different with the development of new concepts. When Darwin's theorizing forced the inclusion of man in the tree of common descent, it caused indeed an ideological revolution. On the other hand, as was correctly emphasized by Popper, Mendel's new paradigm of inheritance did not. Changes in concepts have far more impact than new discoveries. &lt;b&gt;For instance, the replacement of essentialistic by population thinking had a revolutionary impact in the fields of systematics, evolutionary biology, and even outside of science (in politics). This shift had a profound effect on the interpretation of gradualism, speciation, macroevolution, natural selection, and racism.&lt;/b&gt; The rejection of cosmic teleology and of the authority of the Bible have had equally drastic effects on the interpretation of evolution and adaptation. The impact of a revolutionary new concept or discovery on the prevailing paradigm is highly variable. In the case of Darwin's theory of natural selection, the ideological commitment of the preceding paradigm to essentialism, theism, teleology, and physicalism, necessitated not only the most profound revolution ever produced by a new theory but also the longest period of delay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The publication in 1859 of Darwin's &lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt; was unique in representing a multiple scientific revolution. I am referring to the very special case of the simultaneous proposal of several revolutionary theories, such as that of common descent and of natural selection. These are really two independent scientific revolutions and either one can exist without the other. The enthusiastic acceptance of the theory of common descent and the virtual non-acceptance of the theory of natural selection in the first eighty years after 1859 definitely proves this independence. The reason for the difference in reception is that common descent was rather easily accommodated in the thinking of the period while natural selection was not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’ll throw in this 1997 interview, mostly for the last line on Mayr being “one of these euphoric guys.” (And for the reiteration of the deadness of eugenics.)&lt;/p&gt;

Ernst Mayr, one of the world's greatest evolutionary biologists, is interviewed about evolution and other aspects of biology.
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How much do you think we can understand about our nature by taking the perspective of sociobiology, or evolutionary psychology as it's called nowadays? The relationship between men and women,for example?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the behaviors between males and females have nothing to do with sociality. They're behaviors between two individuals, each acting with the ultimate objective to enhance individual reproductive success. This is true even of things like sibling rivalry. Most of these interactions are not social phenomena in the broad sense, and that's why I don't like to call it sociobiology. But when you come to the real social phenomena, the migrations of wildebeests or whales, you won't read a word about them in the sociobiological literature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where do you think the human species is going? Do you believe we can continue to evolve in a genetic sense?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's absolutely no chance of the human species evolving. First of all, we can never speciate. We cover every niche, every spot on the earth, so there's no opportunity for isolation. Moreover, I do not feel there's any natural selection in any positive sense going on right now. &lt;b&gt;Of course, there are those who have talked about eugenics, but we all know that eugenics is impossible for many reasons. I can't see the development of man into superman or anything like that.&lt;/b&gt; Theoretically we could have cultural evolution and develop higher and better concepts. But if you have no basis for a change in genes, then unfortunately you can only develop through cultural evolution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why do you say &quot;unfortunately?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the cultural things can be lost so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On the subject of ethics and eugenics, your own background is interesting. You left Germany in 1931, at the start of the Nazi era.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had a very interesting life, no question about it. I came from the fourth generation in which there was a medical doctor, and I was to be a medical doctor. But I switched to zoology because I was very adventurous and wanted to see the world.. I wanted to go on an expedition. Fortunately just as I was finishing my doctorate, Lord Rothschild needed somebody in New Guinea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Did you like being in New Guinea?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, it's exciting, but it's a tough life, I'll tell you that. I had malaria, I had dysentery, I had dengue, I had everything you can have. Weeks would go by and there was no one to talk to except natives, and I was always alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I understand you were living off the land and eating birds of paradise, among other things. What does a bird of paradise taste like?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most land birds really taste almost about the same. They have a soft and rather flavorful meat. I ate only one bird that was absolutely awful, and that was a cormorant. That was so fishy it was almost inedible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Do you keep a regular schedule for work?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More or less. I have an alarm that wakes me up at 6:15 every morning. I have a little kitchenette. I take one meal outside, and one I make myself. I'm quite active. I write, give lectures, travel abroad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Have you had any major disappointments, any regrets?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The ongoing controversy over the proposal to de-name the Ernst Mayr Award at the Society for Systematic Biology is one of many examples of the ongoing re-examination of the history of evolutionary biology with respect to racism in the 2020s. I have developed many worries about the way that the evaluation of major historical figures in evolutionary biology has been occurring. (I know that the SSB proposal formally tries to avoid having this discussion about Mayr, but evaluating the legacy of a historical figure is simply an unavoidable feature of people reaching a decision about naming/de-naming that historical figure.)

&lt;br /&gt;
To the SSB Council:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have been wracking my brain trying to think of some way to turn the upcoming vote on the Ernst Mayr Award from a divisive into a uniting event for the society. Currently, the problem we face is that a major group of members will feel disenfranchised, no matter which way the vote goes. No one wants that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;I think I’ve come up with a solution that everyone can support, and that will unite all sides. The primary motivation for changing the name of the award is to avoid any exclusion of applications from students from historically underrepresented groups. And yet, removing the name clearly offends many members who admire the outstanding contributions and service of Mayr to SSB and society in general, including his lifetime efforts to make systematics and society more welcoming for all. The latter group includes many student members, as well as members who knew and admired Mayr in life. Both groups are motivated by reasonable concerns, and everyone seems to want to make SSB more welcoming for all.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  
My proposal has two parts: (1) change the name of the award given for the outstanding paper presented at the Annual Meeting by a student member to the Outstanding Student Presentation Award, as in the existing proposal; and (2) change the purpose and mechanism of awarding the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology, to a new award that is selected by committee, without any applications. The new award could be fashioned as a “Nobel Prize in Systematics,” or it could be an award for exemplary service to the society. But there would be no applications, and thus no feeling of exclusion by any potential applicants. Ernst Mayr would continue to be recognized for his important contributions and generous gift to the society’s endowment, and the Outstanding Student Presentation Award would remove any bias from student applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
  
This solution seems to meet the stated goals of all sides, and includes and welcomes all members of the society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope that the Council will consider this uniting solution, as I fear that the vote will otherwise divide the society, no matter the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;

(Jim) Crow, Professor in the Department of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who had been 
a mentor of mine and of many other population geneticists.  Subsequently UW/Madison established the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://genetics.wisc.edu/the-j-f-crow-institute-for-the-study-of-evolution/&quot;&gt;JF Crow Institute for the Study of Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.  Subsequently it has been pointed out that he 
had a connection to eugenics, and there is now serious consideration of removing his name from the eponymous Institute.  The debate is within the UW/M community, and outside opinions 
have not been solicited, and are possibly not welcome.  I am told that the matter will most likely be decided on January 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim was a major influence on me, and I think I also have some insight into his thinking on eugenics.  So it seems appropriate for me to put some thoughts here, to make 
them available to those who want to know who Jim was and what his views were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim (James F.) Crow was my undergraduate supervisor, to whom I am immensely grateful.  In 1961 he encouraged me to hang out in his lab, where I met many population geneticists including Motoo Kimura.  He supervised my Honors Thesis in 1964, which later became my first
sole-authored paper.  When I was thinking about graduate school he asked whether I would consider becoming his graduate student.  I said that he had influenced me greatly, but I wanted to experience other
influences, so I should go elsewhere.  He said there was an interesting young population geneticist Dick Lewontin, and he then arranged for me to spend the summer of 1963 as a student programmer in
Dick Lewontin’s lab (then at the University of Rochester).  That ultimately resulted in me getting my Ph.D. with Dick at the University of Chicago.  For that and more, I am grateful.  Jim played similar
roles with many other theoretical population geneticists and has many people who consider themselves in his debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim considered his own mentor to be H.J. Muller.  In the period after World War II, Muller (the greatest classical geneticist, who proved that radiation could cause mutations) felt that in spite of the catastrophe of Nazi eugenics, that there could be a “good” eugenics, so that humans could direct their own genetic change.  Jim tended to agree with Muller about that.  Their concern was with matters such as the spread of deleterious mutations, Muller’s chief concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its early days, the focus of eugenics had been largely on class rather than race, making sure that the working class did not out-reproduce their rulers.  Eugenicists were hereditarians, who tended to explain differences between humans as likely being genetic (biologists more generally often have that tendency to forget about cultural and social influences on people in their eagerness to point to the importance of biology).  Eugenicists actually did not talk much about “race” but their hereditarian attitude implied biological-determinist views on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim was involved with the quantitative genetics theory used in animal and
plant breeding.  He knew that differences could be either environmental or genetic, and that one could not always tell.  He came from a Quaker family and was politically quite liberal, and of course supported the civil rights movement, 
but he did want to keep the door open for
there to be a “good” eugenics.  Student organizations at the University of Wisconsin had to have faculty advisors listed.  One year, I heard, the NAACP chapter on
campus had asked Jim Crow to be their advisor, which he agreed to.  I think they and Jim just thought it was a good joke.  When the race-and-IQ controversies flared up in 1969 after Arthur
Jensen’s article, I think Jim was ambivalent.  He did not want to totally rule out explaining differences between groups of humans genetically.  He neither defended nor attacked Jensen.  When the issue came up of having the Genetics Society of America 
 pass a resolution dissociating itself from Jensen he was not among those of us who felt it was important to pass a firmly-stated resolution.  Ultimately the GSA passed a resolution so carefully nuanced 
that it had no impact on the public perception of geneticists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should the Crow Institute be renamed?  Abolished?  Defunded? Condemned?  Forgotten? Apologized for?  Wept about? Held up as a Horrible Example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Jim had a large positive effect on the development and understanding of evolutionary theory, both in his theoretical work,
his excellent teaching, his clear writing, and his mentorship of many people.  I think there is very good reason to commemorate him.  But people are complex, and
Jim was no exception.    We all have a tendency to erect heroes and forget that they can have flaws.  We have to guard against idealizing
the people we remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious issue is not who gets what named after them, but how we are to discuss the history of population genetics, including discussing the contributions 
of individuals to the field.  Will the methodology simply be to look for something unacceptable that a contributor has said, declare that 
“of course, we must not judge people by today’s standards”, and then proceed to do precisely that, judge the person by today’s standards?  That 
seems to be what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note that in the Institute’s statement about renaming it was said that “some of us have a deep appreciation for his career and/or considered him a dear friend, whereas others are only beginning to learn about Professor Crow through this controversy”. Unless some way is found to honestly discuss the history of population genetics, the people who are “only beginning” will never get any further in their learning of the history of the field.  If only ideal people can be remembered, then we will have to spend a lot of time and effort forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent the other day sent us a link to an article with this intriguing title, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2022-01-rationality-declined-decades.html&quot;&gt;‘We conclude’ or ‘I believe?’ Study finds rationality declined decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. The study, out of Wageningen and Indiana Universities, suggests that since 1980 public interest has shifted from rationality toward emotion. Those who think we are in a “post-truth” era will not be surprised. It seems to me that this trend, if substantiated, shows that we may be veering away from scientific thinking and evidence to unfounded opinions and unsubstantiated claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above, which does not appear in the paper, leaves something to be desired: We are not told the units of the vertical axes. I am going to guess that they are standard deviations of something. No matter, we can get the drift; from 1850 to 1980, rationality words increased steadily in frequency, whereas intuition words decreased. From 1980 to now, by contrast, rationality words have decreased sharply while intuition words have increased sharply. The figure gives a handful of each type of word (note that “think” and “truth” are counted as intuition words). The dashed line represents the frequency with which the word “facebook” appears; I do not know why it is not quite 0 for the first 150 years of its nonexistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer&quot;&gt;Google nGram&lt;/a&gt; data, the researchers analyzed the language in millions of books and, in the words of the Phys.org article,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;found that words associated with reasoning, such as &quot;determine&quot; and &quot;conclusion,&quot; rose systematically beginning in 1850, while words related to human experience such as &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;believe&quot; declined. This pattern has reversed over the past 40 years, paralleled by a shift from a collectivistic to an individualistic focus as reflected by the ratio of singular to plural pronouns such as &quot;I&quot;/&quot;we.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a look at the original article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/51/e2107848118.full&quot;&gt;The rise and fall of rationality in language&lt;/a&gt;, by Marten Scheffer, Ingrid van de Leemput, Els Weinans, and Johan Bollen. Unfortunately, the article was not written in English, but in a closely related language called Statistics. I know a few words of Statistics, so I managed to decipher the article and get the gist of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors studied the language in millions of books published between 1850 and 2019, using Google nGram data. As the first link above notes, they found first an increase then a decrease in rationality words such as determine and conclusion. They found this pattern in both fiction and nonfiction. As a control, they analyzed words in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and found similar trends. They also performed similar analyses in Spanish to ensure that the findings were not an artifact of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also identified two opposite “poles”: the personal and the societal. The personal pole prefers words that they classify as related to belief or intuition, the body, or various activities. The societal poll prefers words related to science and technology. The authors tentatively relate the personal pole to what they call intuitive thinking, and the societal poll to rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this fall of rationality is not just the result of scientists’ taking my advice and writing in the first person singular when appropriate; it seems to be happening throughout books and periodicals. As the authors note in their abstract,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;… this reversal occurs in fiction as well as nonfiction. Moreover, the pattern of change in the ratio between sentiment and rationality flag words since 1850 also occurs in New York Times articles, suggesting that it is not an artifact of the book corpora we analyzed. Finally, we show that word trends in books parallel trends in corresponding Google search terms, supporting the idea that changes in book language do in part reflect changes in interest. All in all, our results suggest that over the past decades, there has been a marked shift in public interest from the collective to the individual, and from rationality toward emotion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted several people, and one of those contacted yet another. One of my correspondents was skeptical of doing a principal components analysis on z-scores; that is Greek – I mean &lt;i&gt;Statistics&lt;/i&gt; to me. He suggests also that electronic publishing has enabled many, many books that (shall we say) would not have made it as far as an acquisitions editor; he suggests looking at library classification codes, which he thinks are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;obviously a much more reliable indicator of semantic content than are the frequencies of certain words designated as semantic markers of “individuality,” “rationality,” etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;, I agree that it has largely pivoted toward feature articles, and doing so may have simplified its terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person who was contacted by my correspondent pointed to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[l]ess passive construction, more agency in the nouns—both of which tend to shorten the length of sentences, making them easier for readers to read, but also taking up less paper for folks who print these papers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some time after 1980, certainly by 2000, self-published books and self-help books may have altered or distorted the vocabulary. Indeed, as one of my correspondents has noted, in 1850,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;educated&quot; people learned Latin and Greek, and a lot of their writing reflected the grammatical and syntactical influences of those languages (Latin more than Greek). … As we dropped the pretense, scientific communication became more crisp and colloquial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue was that these highly &quot;educated&quot; individuals were almost all of social classes that did not &quot;work&quot; for their money. This was a group of privileged individuals, and one way of marking that privilege was with language: … the writing resembles English, but it has a frame of reference that is all its own, and those standing outside the frame often cannot penetrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Thus,] there is a trend to break down the rhetorical structures that exclude broad swaths of people who might make up a more diverse audience (and market). There certainly is a profit motive, but there is also (potentially) a communitarian motive: people do better if they have easier access to accurate information, so changes in rhetorical structure might be a way to accomplish this [that is, easier access to information] (albeit with downsides as the current COVID outbreak shows us).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know whether this last analysis explains why the turning point is around 1980, but I will let it be the last word.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Examples of trends in the use of words related to rationality (top panel) vs. intuition (bottom panel) (This figure may be used free of rights in press coverage) A correspondent the other day sent us a link to an article with this intriguing title, ‘We conclude’ or ‘I believe?’ Study finds rationality declined decades ago.

&lt;br /&gt;
I find it surprising and sad how quickly the amazing life and accomplishments of Ernst Mayr have faded from the memories of a new generation of biologists. I think Mayr had a bigger and more progressive influence on the development of evolutionary biology in the 20th Century, and the betterment of the world as a whole, than probably any other biologist. 
Mayr emphasized the importance of understanding the natural history of organisms to understand their evolution. He was way ahead of his time in arguing that our emphasis should be on studying whole genomes, rather than individual genes. He spent a lifetime encouraging young people to study biology and the natural world. After immigrating to the US from the horrors of Nazi Germany in the early 1930s, he spoke out against racism and segregation at a time when many of his fellow biologists were doing the opposite. He published over 700 influential articles and 24 books on biological practice and theory, 200 of which he published after he &quot;retired.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mayr worked to establish several major evolutionary societies, including the Society for the Study of Evolution and the Society of Systematic Zoologists (now Society of Systematic Biologists). He not only spent his time and efforts to found and support these societies, he also supported them financially. For example, in the 1970s he endowed a student award within SSZ to encourage young systematists to enter the field (now named the Ernst Mayr Award). That award has long been used to encourage young systematic biologists of diverse backgrounds to become engaged in studying biodiversity. He left an additional large gift to SSB in his will, which became the nucleus of SSB's endowment that has enabled the many programs and funding opportunities that society now provides to encourage young systematists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I greatly admire the life and accomplishments of Mayr, even though he and I frequently disagreed over scientific issues. He was already one of the 20th Century's most famous biologists when I met him, and I was just a lowly graduate student working on bringing molecular techniques into systematics. Mayr was not a big fan of this; he was not anti-molecular systematics, but he argued (quite reasonably) that single gene analyses of systematic questions were problematic, and he thought that many molecular systematists did not pay enough attention to the biology and natural history of their organisms (which was often true). After I co-edited the book Molecular Systematics in 1990, he and I often discussed the development and expansion of molecular techniques in the field. But despite our disagreements over this (as well as various issues of systematic theory), he was always cordial, encouraging, warm, and most of all—knowledgeable. It was always clear to me that he read the literature exhaustively. When he asked me questions about or critiqued my papers, it was clear that he had read and thought about them carefully. He had a command of the literature like no one else that I'd ever encountered, or have encountered since. He taught me that people can disagree about issues, and still be great friends (in fact, it can even help and build a friendship to discuss such disagreements).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people today likely picture Mayr as an old man, as he was over 100 when he died in 2005, and most living people would remember him (if at all) as an old man. This photo of him (on the right in the photo) shows him as a 23-year-old field biologist in New Guinea in 1928. He had an enormous, positive influence on the world, and especially on the positive development of evolutionary and systematic biology. We should remember and thank him for that. He worked to make the world, and his discipline, better than they were when he came into them. I think that is the lofty goal that we should all strive to achieve in our lives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hillis posted additional comments to his Facebook post on January 6, 2022:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I am deeply saddened to see in today's e-mail a proposal to eliminate Ernst Mayr's name from the Society of Systematic Biology's Ernst Mayr Award. As this post from last year describes, Mayr was champion of inclusion and diversity; he worked to fight discrimination in science; he supported young scientists, and endowed the student award that bares his name. Members of the society will get to vote on this constitutional change, and I hope that they have the wisdom to continue honoring his life and contributions with this named award.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposal to change the name claims that some members disagree with some of his writings, even though Mayr &quot;was a prolific and profound scholar of evolutionary biology and a dedicated champion of students.&quot; Really? We are now eliminating mention of people because someone disagrees with some of their academic ideas? That is especially troublesome in this case, as Mayr was an ardent defender of equality and inclusion, and spoke out effectively against racial discrimination (as discussed below).
Please, if you are a member of SSB, vote against this mean-spirited and unfair discrimination against Mayr on the spring 2022 ballot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…and then…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(210, 210, 210); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Hillis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Even given all of Mayr's vast biological accomplishments, I think what most impresses me about him were his efforts to build a better world for all. For example, in 1951, in support of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000073351&quot;&gt;UNESCO 1951: The race concept: Results of an inquiry&lt;/a&gt;,” Mayr made a public statement opposing the views of R. A. Fisher, and supporting the UNESCO statement:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mayr stated that he hoped that “the authoritative Statement prepared by UNESCO will help to eliminate the pseudo-scientific race conceptions which have been used as excuses for many injustices and even shocking crimes”… “I applaud and wholeheartedly endorse [it],” Mayr wrote, adding: “It cannot be emphasized too strongly that all so-called races are variable populations, and that there is often more difference between extreme individuals of one race than between certain individuals of different races. All human races are mixtures of populations and the term “pure race” is an absurdity. The second important point which needs stressing is that genetics plays a very minor part in the cultural characteristics of different peoples. . . . The third point is that equality of opportunity and equality in law do not depend on physical, intellectual and genetic identity. There are striking differences in physical, intellectual and other genetically founded qualities among individuals of even the most homogeneous human population, even among brothers and sisters. No acknowledged ethical principle exists which would permit denial of equal opportunity for reason of such differences to any member of the human species.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three years later, US Supreme Court cited this same Mayr-supported UNESCO statement in the landmark desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Mayr spoke up and did the right thing at a critical time, when many of his colleagues were doing the opposite.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.systbio.org/award-naming.html&quot;&gt;SSB announcement about de-naming the Ernst Mayr Award&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(227, 180, 180); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;SSB Council Review of the Mayr Award and Award Names&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the summer of 2020, the SSB Council began a discussion about potentially renaming the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology at the request of society members. Since then, the SSB leadership have been working in conjunction with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to learn more about the origin of named awards and their representation of the diverse membership within the society. Renaming the award is one step toward greater inclusivity within the society, as named awards often lead to feelings of exclusion among those who are members of underrepresented groups whose scientific contributions continue to remain unrecognized. At a council meeting following Virtual Evolution 2021, the Council voted to propose to all members an award name change, in conjunction with other actions intended to better recognize SSB’s history and legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The SSB Council proposes to rename the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology to the Outstanding Student Presentation Award in Systematic Biology. Our scientific community is more diverse than the cohort of early scientists with recognized contributions to systematics and science generally. Many current members do not see themselves reflected in awards that bear the names of these early scientists and can feel excluded as potential recipients as a result. In a field whose composition still does not reflect global human diversity, having an award named after a particular individual reinforces that members with other identities are outsiders. By proposing this name change, we hope to address this specific barrier to making our society more inclusive and welcoming. We, the SSB council, are made up of a diverse group of people who don’t all view Mayr in the same light. This proposal is not intended to cast judgement on the legacy of Ernst Mayr, who was a prolific and profound scholar of evolutionary biology and a dedicated champion of students, nor are we intending to defend the contents of his writings which some find problematic. We are grateful for Mayr’s generous gifts to our society, which created the endowment that allows us to support student research today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Council sees preservation of the society’s history and increasing diversity, equity and inclusion as synergistic endeavors toward the improvement of our community. The proposed change continues our history of becoming more inclusive over time: for example, in the 1990s we changed from the Society for Systematic Zoology to the Society of Systematic Biologists (and changed the journal name as well) to welcome members of our community who do not study animals. Thus, SSB President Laura Kubatko has acted on the recommendation of the DEI Committee to form a new committee, the SSB Legacy Committee, that will be tasked with creating accessible content about our society's history (e.g., as a section on our website). The formation of this committee is intended as a way to acknowledge the contributions of past members to the existence of the society and to the field broadly. In this way, the legacy of the society may be understood by our membership more comprehensively than is possible through named awards, and we have the opportunity to celebrate the many people of various backgrounds who have made systematic biology what it is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Because the award is named in our Constitution, the name can only be changed by a formal amendment to the Constitution. Following the procedure outlined in our Constitution, the SSB Council thus voted in August 2021 to propose an Amendment to the Constitution to be submitted to the SSB Membership for a vote. The Constitution specifies that the proposed Amendment will pass if at least 2/3 of the members vote in favor. This issue will be presented to the membership on the Spring 2022 ballot. The proposed amendment is shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My attempts to put some context onto Twitter in the midst of the Great R.A. Fisher Panic of June 2020 – almost wholly unsuccessfully, I might add – are here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1: https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1270280876958474240 &lt;br /&gt;
Part 2: https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1270287477928939521&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, some of the back-and-forth over Fisher in June 2020 was the origin of the SSB Mayr Award controversy, i.e. these posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/Lagomarsino_L/status/1270856892630339601 &lt;br /&gt;
https://twitter.com/landismj/status/1270756154940022784&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version of my argument in June 2020 was that we shouldn’t make hasty judgments about R.A. Fisher, because if you have read much about the history of eugenics or scientific racism, and the history of the opposition to the same, you realise that many of the people who made substantial progress in defeating these repugnant views did not achieve perfection instantaneously.  Views on race and eugenics changed gradually, step-by-step, with some mistakes and prejudices (e.g. polygenism) defeated long before others (e.g. the idea that biological race referred to real, meaningful categories). The people who fought against Nazi eugenics before World War 2 were largely eugenicists themselves (but “reform eugenicists”).  There were anti-racist eugenicists, anti-eugenics racists, etc.  None of this should be surprising to evolutionary biologists, of all people, who generally have an instinct for the importance and complexity of history, and how gradual change in many small steps can add up to big changes where the end result is almost unrecognizable from the beginning point.  The interesting thing about progress in moral views is not when it is done by people who are morally perfect. The interesting thing is when this progress is made by imperfect people, despite received wisdom and their initial prejudices. The process is, I think, not unlike scientific discovery. And in the case of racism &amp;amp; eugenics, scientific discoveries and moral progress were often linked, and many of the people who did the linking were the very evolutionary greats who are now being canned right and left.  For all of these reasons and more, it is more important to acknowledge the important progress people made, rather than the inherited assumptions they failed to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this, and more, would have to be taken into consideration in a fair evaluation of R.A. Fisher.  Using the old creationist tactic of quote-mining and putting up something that looks bad on Twitter is not a reliable method for judgment of historical matters. So, in the midst of discussing these issues in a heated Twitter discussion, I said, consider Ernst Mayr: if you google his name plus the word “eugenics”, which anyone can do very easily, you find something. You can play this trick for almost any biologist and/or progressive active between about 1900 and 1970. I never imagined people would take this seriously enough in the case of Ernst Mayr to begin discussing de-naming his award.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Now, I have to acknowledge that I have been told by Josef Uyeda that (1) those Twitter replies may have kicked off the SSB Board’s discussion of the Mayr Award, but (2) no one made a serious case against Ernst Mayr that he heard about, and the denaming proposal and vote is really, truly, not about Mayr’s views or reputation, but about the abstract issue of whether or not awards should be named after individuals at all.  (I guess everything from the Nobel Prize on down should be denamed according to this logic.) I am happy to acknowledge his representation of his views. However, I think that the SSB proposal text itself, and the overall context of canning famous evolutionists left and right without anything resembling historical due diligence, indicates that much more is involved. We are living through an age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm&quot;&gt;iconoclasm&lt;/a&gt;, and legitimate rage against Trumpism, massive economic inequality, Covid denialism, and the rest, is being redirected to all kinds of weird places due to the difficulty of fixing the core problems.  It is all made worse by everyone being even more online than usual due to the pandemic, physical libraries and old paper books and sources being less accessible than usual, and the lack of face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read Uyeda’s views in his own words at his Twitter thread, here: https://twitter.com/pseudacris/status/1479177881360207874&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you are in SSB, please vote against this proposal. Spasms of iconoclasm have to burn out somewhere, and it would be a further honor to Ernst Mayr if his award was the firebreak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nick Matzke</name></author><summary type="html">David Hillis posted the following short essay to Facebook on June 21, 2021.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Old arguments never die, they just get recycled.  From Wikimedia.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the end of 2021, which has been a fairly miserable year for most of us.  So it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what is the most ridiculous argument put forward this year for ID or for creationism.  I’m going to give my own choice, which is both highly technical and highly absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you get to make a nomination of your own. (There will no winner chosen or prize awarded).  The argument need not be one that was first proposed in 2021, as long as it continued to be put forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own choice is the Algorithmic Specified Complexity argument, which purports to show mathematically that
high levels of adaptation cannot be achieved, because the length of the “program” used is unusually short, and
this is backed up by very impressive, and sometimes quite correct, mathematical proofs.  The effort is usually
to show that the length of the program needed is conserved, so perhaps it cannot be changed by evolution.  Perhaps.    I’ve ranted and
raved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;another
post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
about the wrongness of this two years ago here.  But the argument has never been disowned by any of its
advocates, including Robert Marks, Winston Ewert, or Eric Holloway.  So it is still out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it is silly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There never is any attempt by its advocates to show that an unusually simple program is needed for a highly fit
adaptation, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is never clarified whether the “program” computes the genotype, the phenotype, or something else, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the name is ludicrous: “Complexity” is achieved by the program being unusually simple (the reverse of
the way algorithmic complexity theory is used to discuss random numbers),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The distribution of binary bitstrings used is totally arbitrary, and there could be many others as well- (or ill-)
justified.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Somehow they still expect people to consider their argument to be meaningful biologically.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument has such a tension between its mathematical pretentiousness and its basic meaninglessness that
for me it achieves worstness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, that’s my candidate for Worst.  What’s yours?  We have quite a few wise heads here who are quite familiar with the
arguments ID advocates and creationists make.  If you aren’t as familiar, just take a look at the Discovery Institute’s “Evolution
News and Science Today” site and start reading stories there.  It will supply
you with lots of candidates.

It is the end of 2021, which has been a fairly miserable year for most of us. So it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what is the most ridiculous argument put forward this year for ID or for creationism. I’m going to give my own choice, which is both highly technical and highly absurd. But you get to make a nomination of your own. (There will no winner chosen or prize awarded). The argument need not be one that was first proposed in 2021, as long as it continued to be put forward. My own choice is the Algorithmic Specified Complexity argument, which purports to show mathematically that high levels of adaptation cannot be achieved, because the length of the “program” used is unusually short, and this is backed up by very impressive, and sometimes quite correct, mathematical proofs. The effort is usually to show that the length of the program needed is conserved, so perhaps it cannot be changed by evolution. Perhaps. I’ve ranted and raved in another post about the wrongness of this two years ago here. But the argument has never been disowned by any of its advocates, including Robert Marks, Winston Ewert, or Eric Holloway. So it is still out there. Here’s why it is silly: There never is any attempt by its advocates to show that an unusually simple program is needed for a highly fit adaptation, and It is never clarified whether the “program” computes the genotype, the phenotype, or something else, and Even the name is ludicrous: “Complexity” is achieved by the program being unusually simple (the reverse of the way algorithmic complexity theory is used to discuss random numbers), The distribution of binary bitstrings used is totally arbitrary, and there could be many others as well- (or ill-) justified.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent sent us this tweet by Ken Ham:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; There's only one way to go back in time &amp;amp; that's to read the true history of the universe God revealed to us in His Word beginning in Genesis. &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&quot; (Job 38:4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Mr. Ham’s take on the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. I find it astonishing, even for something coming from Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it gives quoting out of context a very bad name. The story of Job is a horrible one (I have written a bit more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, pp. 160-168). In the book, God gives Satan permission to torture Job and kill his family, for no other reason than to win a bet with Satan. Job, in contrast to God, seems to believe in justice or fairness, and calls out to God to show him his guilt. God’s response is to mock Job. Chapter 38, the chapter cited by Mr. Ham, reads (according to the 1985 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sefaria.org/Job.38.4?lang=bi&quot;&gt;JPS Tanakh&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak if you have understanding. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Onto what were its bases sunk? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who set its cornerstone …? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God to goes on to browbeat and belittle Job. Though God never addresses Job’s concern, Job finally gives in, admitting that he is “but dust and ashes.” How such a reprehensible story buttresses the case for creation escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, and perhaps worse, a careful reading of the text shows clearly that its author thought of the earth as a solid object with a physical foundation and a base that was sunk into something (perhaps like a pile driven into the earth?). Unsurprisingly, then, we find that Mr. Ham is quoting as an authority an author who thinks that the earth is a flat slab, possibly sitting on some unknown foundation into which piles have been driven, and probably with a dome over it. (Possibly that foundation is sitting on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;.) Hardly a portion of the Bible that I would want to quote if I wanted to cite an authority on the creation of the earth. But with Mr. Ham, we never know. Any out-of-context quotation will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">A correspondent sent us this tweet by Ken Ham: There's only one way to go back in time &amp;amp; that's to read the true history of the universe God revealed to us in His Word beginning in Genesis. &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&quot; (Job 38:4) It is Mr. Ham’s take on the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.
