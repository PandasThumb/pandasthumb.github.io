&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anas platyrhynchos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – mallard duck, Boulder, Colorado, March, 2024. I am no great fan of mallard ducks (we have almost as many as we have Canada geese, but at least they seem to be housebroken). This one, a male, must have had especially clean, new feathers, because he clearly shows the green, iridescent coloring on his head. That is, the coloring is not due to pigment, but rather interference colors owing to layering in the feathers. You can tell because the color faces you, but is absent elsewhere. Mallards also show bluish iridescence farther back, but that is not visible in this picture. Like many things, the green head looks better in life than in a photograph, but a photograph is the best I can do.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the floatless Ark seen from the rear. &lt;small&gt;Photograph by Dan Phelps.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Braterman reported earlier that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/Martyn-Iles-Is-Executive.html&quot;&gt; Martyn Iles is the new Executive CEO of Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Braterman found the appointment of Mr. Iles troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Iles was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/01/martyn-iles-is-new-ceo-of-creation-museum-ark-encounter/72004202007/&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; the other day by Jolene Almendarez of the Cincinnati Enquirer. I will admit that I was slightly put off by Ms. Almendarez’s first comment, that “most” reputable scientists and educators debunk AIG’s “controversial” claims about the age of the earth and so on. Nevertheless, it was a good interview which asked pertinent questions – though I fear that it will make Prof. Braterman no less troubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of Mr. Iles’s remarks. In response to a question about how AIG will change under his leadership, he said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; So it used to be that the main argument raised by the culture to say Christianity is false is that evolution is true. I just don't think that's where we are anymore. We're much more into social issues about climate change, racial issues, LGBT issues, all that kind of stuff. ... [ellipsis in original] So there's kind of a broadening of the message ….&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the usual conflation of Christianity with Mr. Iles’s bizarre brand of evangelical Christianity, we see the expansion into “social issues” that troubled Prof. Braterman. And well it should. In case you wonder just what kind of person we are dealing with, I will anticipate the last sentence in the article, which claims that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Iles has also supported controversial rugby player Israel Folau, who posted online “drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolators” would go to hell if they don't repent, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; reported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the interview. Regarding climate change, Mr. Iles assured us that climate change would not destroy the world; rather, God would do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: When do you think the world will be destroyed by climate change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: (Laughs) My philosophy is that God will destroy it first. God has a plan for the world, and it will exist until he's done with it. ... I mean, we could do some damage in the meantime, don't get me wrong, but we're not going to completely destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: That's the most optimistic perspective I've ever heard about climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: (Laughs more) There's a lot of optimism in this message, I've got to tell you. It all ends well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am certainly relieved to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed answer to a question, Mr. Iles stressed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message will include anything that is introduced in the book of Genesis – this includes race, climate change, family, sexuality, gender, (all LGBTQ issues) [parentheses in original], identity, life, truth, the problem of evil, political power, and others. Many contemporary topics.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more, including plans to introduce digital technology such as virtual reality. But I will leave that to read for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">A view of the floatless Ark seen from the rear. Photograph by Dan Phelps.

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading, intermittently, I afraid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JBJS1MF/&quot;&gt; An Immense World&lt;/a&gt;, subtitled “How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,” by Ed Yong. The book is about senses: vision, touch, pain, hearing, taste, smell, but also heat, vibration, electric and magnetic fields, and echoes and echolocation. I am about up to the part where he tries to tell you, with a sort of apology to Thomas Nagel, what it is like to be a bat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I heard Mr. Yong interviewed by Arielle Duhaime-Ross last week on Science Friday, under the title, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/an-immense-world-umwelt-animals/&quot;&gt;Expanding our Umwelt: Understanding animal experiences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Umwelt&lt;/i&gt; is a German word that Mr. Yong borrows to mean “the part of [its] surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; ran an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/animals-vision-video.html&quot;&gt;A bird’s-eye view of a Technicolor world&lt;/a&gt;, by Emily Anthes. This article shows some videos supposedly demonstrating what the world might look like to a bird whose vision is sensitive to ultraviolet light. There seemed to be an implicit assumption that ultraviolet looked a lot like violet and the birds see the primary colors about the same as we do, but never mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am supposed to know something about optics and even a little bit about vision. I once read Ivan Schwab’s monumental work &lt;i&gt;Evolution’s Witness: How Eyes Evolved&lt;/i&gt; cover to cover and discussed it on Panda’s Thumb, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/07/evolutions-witn.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Yet in the chapter on vision I learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;that a certain kind of jumping spider has a Galilean telescope in each of 2 eyes and can see about as acutely as a dog. Its retinas are weird, but you will have to read the book to find out how. The field-of-view of each telescope is greatly limited, but that is OK because the spider has 4 other eyes to work with;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;that birds of prey have 2 foveas, one for tracking prey and one for looking at the horizon;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;that a certain microbe sports an eye that uses a reflecting mirror instead of a lens, all in a single cell (I showed a picture of a single-celled microbe that contained a focusing lens in the article on Prof. Schwab's book, so the concept of a microbe with an eye was interesting but not entirely shocking).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the book on a Kindle Paperwhite, which gives a black-and-white image. A photographic gallery was lumped at the back of the book and not particularly good in black-and-white, so I had to go to a computer to look at them. Except for, I think, 2 embedded figures, none was called out in the text, so you could not easily link the photographs back to the appropriate portion of the text. Additionally, I hereby lodge my perennial complaint about endnotes: Each chapter had countless endnotes, and most contained interesting and important information. Indeed, I learned about the foveas of birds of prey in an endnote in a chapter about bats and of the microbe with the reflecting mirror in another endnote. All of that material should have been worked into the text. If I had had a hard copy of the book – a codex – and had to shuffle back-and-forth 20-odd times in a given chapter, my Umwelt would have been greatly disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; article is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002444&quot;&gt;Recording animal-view videos of the natural world using a novel camera system and software package&lt;/a&gt;, by Vera Vasas, &lt;i&gt;et&lt;/i&gt; 14 other &lt;i&gt;alia&lt;/i&gt;, Plos Biology, January 23, 2024. I have barely glanced at the article and will likely not read it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I have been reading, intermittently, I afraid, An Immense World, subtitled “How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,” by Ed Yong.

The WV News noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to WV Public Broadcasting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wvpublic.org/lawmakers-hear-support-for-intelligent-design-in-public-schools/&quot;&gt;two high school students&lt;/a&gt;, Haden Hodge and Hunter Bernard, argued that intelligent-design creationism is not a religious argument. Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps, who is from Kentucky and has been fighting this kind of nonsense for years, adds, “Let us hope that this doesn’t spread to Kentucky; our legislature would fall for ID creationism very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears as though the answer to the initial question, “Is intelligent-design creationism making a comeback?” may be a qualified “Yes.” Specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/catalyzing-action/sign-ncse-monitor&quot;&gt;NCSE Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly newsletter published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/&quot;&gt; National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, today noted several “intelligent design” bills besides those in West Virginia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/maines-problematic-proposed-revisions-science-standards-under-fire&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;: A proposal to encourage middle school &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; teachers to teach about genocide, eugenics, and the Holocaust. Maybe we should &quot;encourage&quot; middle school history teachers to teach evolution. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/mandatory-intelligent-design-bill-oklahoma&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;: A Senate bill to require public or charter school teachers to teach &quot;the concepts of creationism and/or intelligent design&quot; if they teach evolution. NCSE points out that teaching &quot;intelligent design&quot; has been deemed unconstitutional by a Federal court because it is a religious view [quotation marks in original]. Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/two-intelligent-design-bills-oklahoma&quot;&gt;similar bills&lt;/a&gt; have been prefiled in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/west-virginias-former-intelligent-design-bill-passes-senate&quot;&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;: According to NCSE, the Senate bill has passed and now states that &quot;[n]o public school board, school superintendent, or school principal shall prohibit a public school classroom teacher from discussing or answering questions from students about scientific theories of how the universe and/or life came to exist.&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">The ever-vigilant Dan Phelps has sent us a couple of links from West Virginia, where their Senate education committee approved a bill that would allow the teaching of intelligent-design creationism in the public schools. The WV News noted that The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics. The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom. According to WV Public Broadcasting, two high school students, Haden Hodge and Hunter Bernard, argued that intelligent-design creationism is not a religious argument. Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument. Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did. Mr. Phelps, who is from Kentucky and has been fighting this kind of nonsense for years, adds, “Let us hope that this doesn’t spread to Kentucky; our legislature would fall for ID creationism very quickly.” Added February 2, 2024, at about 10:00 MDT: It appears as though the answer to the initial question, “Is intelligent-design creationism making a comeback?” may be a qualified “Yes.” Specifically, NCSE Monitor, a weekly newsletter published by the National Center for Science Education, today noted several “intelligent design” bills besides those in West Virginia: Maine: A proposal to encourage middle school science teachers to teach about genocide, eugenics, and the Holocaust. Maybe we should &quot;encourage&quot; middle school history teachers to teach evolution.

And finally, West Virginia: According to NCSE, the Senate bill has passed and now states that &quot;[n]o public school board, school superintendent, or school principal shall prohibit a public school classroom teacher from discussing or answering questions from students about scientific theories of how the universe and/or life came to exist.&quot; Stay tuned!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AIG's “Answers Academy” K-12 school renovated by far right foundation money</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/aigs-answers-academy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AIG's “Answers Academy” K-12 school renovated by far right foundation money" /><published>2024-01-17T15:28:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-01-17T15:28:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/aigs-answers-academy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/aigs-answers-academy.html">&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year, Answers in Genesis completed moving their K-12 Answers Academy school into the $31 million former Toyota USA Headquarters building in northern Kentucky.

&lt;p&gt;Lionel Dahmer, the father of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer – the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/crime/jeffrey-dahmer&quot;&gt;Milwaukee Monster&lt;/a&gt;&quot; who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys (mostly African Americans) – died on December 5, 2023. Lionel was the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781635615630&quot;&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/a&gt;, a memoir of his son's youth first published in 1994. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/us/lionel-dahmer-dead.html&quot;&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;Mr. Dahmer described himself in his book as ‘almost totally analytical'—a chemist, comforted by the scientific predictability of his work, whose emotional life resembled a ‘broad, flat plain.'&quot; But in fact, Lionel underwent a conversion experience in 1989 that affected not only his conception of the relation between religion and science, but also how his son is remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tSxuyM93Js&quot;&gt;Interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt;'s Stone Phillips in 1994, Jeffrey characterized evolution as the idea that &quot;we all just came from the slime,&quot; described it as &quot;a complete lie … [with] no basis in science to uphold it,&quot; and contended that &quot;the whole theory cheapens life.&quot; Implicit in his rambling remarks is the following argument: evolution entails that there is no God to whom we are morally accountable; only if there is a God to whom we are morally accountable is there reason for us to behave morally; therefore, accepting evolution robs us of any reason to behave morally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of any reader inclined to take their scientific or philosophical pointers from a college drop-out like Jeffrey, it should be noted that the scientific consensus on evolution is overwhelming, with over 98 percent of American scientists accepting human evolution in a 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-express-strikingly-different-views-about-science-related-issues/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;; that evolution, like science in general, is typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5787/chapter/6#58&quot;&gt;regarded&lt;/a&gt; as intrinsically silent on the existence of God; and that there are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/&quot;&gt;plethora&lt;/a&gt; of philosophical accounts of morality in which God is not central. It's also not clear why slime is supposed to be a worse origin than the Biblical alternative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;the dust of the ground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet creationists are disturbingly fond of invoking Jeffrey Dahmer. To take a few examples at random: the creationist ministries &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/search/?refinement=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;q=dahmer&quot;&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://creation.com/search?q=dahmer&quot;&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt; discuss Jeffrey in virtually identical terms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/trouble-paradise&quot;&gt;reflecting&lt;/a&gt; their common ancestry; a professor of philosophy at a fundamentalist university paraphrased the &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; remarks while participating in a three-way &lt;a href=&quot;https://zondervanacademic.com/products/three-views-on-creation-and-evolution&quot;&gt;internecine creationist debate&lt;/a&gt;; and Jeffrey is credited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5661968/&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt; as appearing in &quot;Kent Hovind: An Atheist's Worst Nightmare,&quot; a 2006 self-promoting film from a flamboyant creationist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2015/07/10/hovind-free-jail-back-pensacola/29969745/&quot;&gt;convicted felon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these invocations reach a broader audience. In 2009, for example, as the Texas state board of education was conducting a revision of the state science standards, members of the radical Christian right were hoping for the retention of &quot;strengths and weaknesses&quot; language that was invoked as a pretext to undermine the teaching of evolution. The Texas Freedom Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfn.org/jeffrey-dahmer-believed-in-evolution/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time on a lobbying email with the unsubtle all-caps subject line &quot;JEFFREY DAHMER, SERIAL KILLER, BELIEVED IN EVOLUTION—WHY ‘WEAKNESSES' NEEDS TO STAY IN TEXAS SCIENCE STANDARDS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is Jeffrey's claim that he formerly believed that evolution licensed his ghastly crimes actually evidence of anything? Even if he was sincere and accurate, it would be unwarranted to generalize from his single case, as Lionel conceded in the appendix to the 2021 edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781635615630&quot;&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/a&gt;. And while he may have been sincere—Roy Ratliff, who ministered to him in prison, reported similar remarks from him in his own book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9780976779025&quot;&gt;Dark Journey Deep Grace: Jeffrey Dahmer's Story of Faith&lt;/a&gt;—there is no reason to regard him as insightful about his own twisted psyche, and no evidence that he was interested in evolution before his imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a plausible source for Jeffrey's claim independent of his own murderous career: creationism itself. In the appendix to the 2021 edition of &lt;i&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/i&gt;, Lionel revealed that from 1989 onward he was sending &quot;tapes and articles&quot; espousing creationism to his son, who (according to Lionel) ignored them until after his imprisonment. Roy Ratliff reported that while in prison Jeffrey continued to receive material from his father discussing &quot;the creation of the world and how evolution is untrue,&quot; which Jeffrey credited with bringing him to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is inevitable that the creationist materials that Lionel plied Jeffrey with, before and after his imprisonment, contained a hefty dose of the claim that acceptance of evolution causes moral bankruptcy. Indeed, the idea that accepting evolution is connected to religious apostasy, moral turpitude, and social decay is among the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://shuddhashar.com/learning-from-the-american-evolution-wars/&quot;&gt;pillars of creationism&lt;/a&gt;, the main rhetorical themes used by creationists hoping to influence the public. Subsisting on such a doctrinaire diet, it is hardly surprising that Jeffrey was primed to repeat the claim during his &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why was Lionel sending creationist materials to Jeffrey? In the initial edition of &lt;i&gt;A Father's Story&lt;/i&gt;, Lionel was circumspect about his attitude toward evolution. He wrote that while in prison in 1992, his son used $130, anonymously donated, to purchase thirteen creationist books, neutrally adding, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It amazed him that a scientific theory that had been received as an unarguable scientific fact during all the years of his education might rest on questionable assumptions. It seemed to delight him that so thoroughly accepted an idea could be questioned, that nothing stood on truly solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the appendix to the 2021 edition of his book, however, Lionel disclosed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989, I myself ‘returned' fully to God, being influenced by the urging of my son, Dave, and profoundly affected by a seminar presented by a scientist from Montgomery, Alabama, Dr. Bert Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thompson was indeed a scientist, earning a Ph.D. in microbiology from Texas A&amp;amp;M University in 1975, but he spent the bulk of his career &quot;spread[ing] young-earth creationism throughout the Churches of Christ,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9780674023390&quot;&gt;as the historian Ronald L. Numbers wrote&lt;/a&gt;, including through a ministry called Apologetics Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Thompson, Lionel was briefly active in organized creationism himself, presenting a poster at the 1990 International Conference on Creationism and publishing a 1991 &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1458&amp;amp;context=icc_proceedings&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the conference's proceedings. The research purported to challenge the scientifically ascertained dates of dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our radiocarbon dates of dinosaur bones and the other information in this report should be alarming to the evolutionary community and should be given serious study considering our preliminary results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: the &quot;evolutionary community&quot; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nabt.org/files/galleries/February2020ABT.pdf&quot;&gt;unmoved&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, pp. 72-79).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in light of the proclivity of creationists to quote Jeffrey's &lt;i&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/i&gt; interview to illustrate the claim that accepting evolution causes moral bankruptcy, the career of the second author of Lionel's paper—Dmitri A. Kouznetsov, then a superstar of Russian creationism—imploded in the mid-1990s owing to accusations of scholarly dishonesty. According to the historian Ronald L. Numbers, Kouznetsov then reinvented himself as a supposed expert on the Shroud of Turin, &quot;using fake samples from nonexistent museums,&quot; and subsequently served time for passing bad checks in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is similarly ironic that Bert Thompson, whom Lionel credited with his return to God, was fired from Apologetics Press in 2005, amid accusations of sexual misconduct. &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianchronicle.org/longtime-director-of-apologetics-press-fired/&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to a story in &lt;i&gt;The Christian Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, which serves the Churches of Christ, a member of the church alleged that &quot;Thompson started sending him cards and letters when he was 13, then pressed him to go out to dinner after he turned 16, the legal age of consent in Alabama.&quot; After dinner, Thompson took the youth to his home and &quot;lured him to a bedroom, disrobed and touched him inappropriately.&quot; It was not the only such accusation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Lionel was aware of or troubled by the alleged moral failings of his collaborator and his inspiration is unclear. In any case, he seems not to have been active in organized creationism after 1991, which is not surprising given the disruption of his life by his son's arrest, trial, conviction, imprisonment, and murder. But he continued to harbor doubts about the scientific bona fides of evolution, judging from the appendix to the 2021 edition of his memoir, and he still appears in propagandistic lists of scientists who accept creationism, including the list put out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://creation.com/scientists-alive-today-who-accept-the-biblical-account-of-creation&quot;&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
