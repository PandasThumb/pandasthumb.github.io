&lt;p&gt;A new article has been published in the illustrious journal &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Burgess, S. (2022). &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.3&quot;&gt;Why the Ankle-Foot Complex Is a Masterpiece of Engineering and a Rebuttal of “Bad Design” Arguments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt;, 2022.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with it, &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] is a journal dedicated to publishing work from the Intelligent Design creationist community. Frustrated by their almost completely futile efforts to get their work or ideas published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, intelligent design proponents took to creating their own journal in 2010 with Douglas Axe as the founding editor-in-chief. Axe was also head of the Biologic Institute, the only research institute dedicated to intelligent design creationism, and the publisher of &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]. The institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/biologic-institute-closes.html&quot;&gt;has now closed&lt;/a&gt;. No word yet on what will happen with the journal, but I imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/inteliigent-design-think-tanks-institute-is-a-shutterstock-image/&quot;&gt;the green screen&lt;/a&gt; has been repurposed. You can read more about the history of the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/latest-intelligent-design-journal&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] and The Biologic Institute (and Axe himself to a certain extent), are all funded by the Discovery Institute, the organizing body of the intelligent design creationist movement, which probably needs no introduction to the readers of Panda’s Thumb. But in case you’ve just crawled out of the Olduvai Gorge, you can read about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new article on the human ankle by Stuart Burgess perfectly aligns with the grand traditions of &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is just the third and final article published in in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/issue/view/36&quot;&gt;in all of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Their original ambitious goal was one article per month (lol), but they have yet to exceed four articles in any calendar year. In 2017, they published just one manuscript in the &quot;research article&quot; category and one &quot;critical review.&quot; This year, the three published articles are in the &quot;critical focus&quot; category, meaning they did not publish a single “research article” in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The article above was written by someone who is also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/about/editorialTeam&quot;&gt;the editorial board&lt;/a&gt; of the journal. In fact, nearly all of the contributing authors in the history of the journal are also editors and most are also Discovery Institute fellows or contributors. In 2010-2011, the journal published a total of seven articles across all article types, four of them co-authored by editor-in-chief Douglas Axe. Of course, it is not unheard of that a journal &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; publishes original work by someone on the editorial board, but this practice is usually kept to a minimum for obvious reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2022 was exceptional, however, because the three articles published in &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] are all by different authors! In most years, to reach the impressive feat of 3 or 4 articles, they publish multiple articles from the same author or team of authors, essentially by cutting articles into pieces. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/issue/view/35&quot;&gt;the entire published work of the journal in 2021&lt;/a&gt; is three articles, all by the same author, with titles ending in &quot;part 1,&quot; &quot;part 2,&quot; and &quot;part 3.&quot; In the year before that, two of the four published articles were by the same trio of authors and cover the same topic. The exact same was true for 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The reason the article above caught my attention is that it is written as a rebuttal to a few paragraphs in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/book-human-errors/&quot;&gt;2018 popular science book &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I am mentioned by name 19 times (20 if you count the reference list), including in the abstract and in one of the section headings. I am most flattered by this continued attention, but it is not exactly in keeping with the standards and customs of academic science. Scientific data and ideas generally stand on their own and are offered on their own terms. While debates and rebuttals are also part of science, and I have been involved in some of those as well, they are never structured as a debate between persons, especially in the published literature. This article reads more like a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.3&quot;&gt;article itself&lt;/a&gt; is simply a summary of the structure and function of the human ankle, which can be summed up by saying the ankle is incredibly complex and good at what it does (notwithstanding the strains and sprains we all get). Somehow, this is offered as evidence against evolution and for intelligent design. Please feel free to read the article itself and comment below if you find any evidence against the notion that the human ankle is the product of standard evolutionary forces. I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, in the words of fellow Panda’s Thumb contributor Anj Petto, an expert in functional morphology, “There is not a single aspect of the ankle that I can think of that exists in anticipation of the needs for the particular combination of stability, strength, and flexibility that bipedal striding requires. All of the pieces exist in the generalized primate foot, and there is a series of changes in the foot among the hominins (certainly from &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; forward) that show transitional features that reduce the muscle activity required to walking on 2 legs so that in the modern human ankle (foot, knee, hips, and lower back, as well) the skeletal system (bones, joints, cartilage, and ligaments) are supporting the upright posture so that the muscles are mostly used for propulsion rather than for supporting the upright posture.” This latter item is among the points I was making in &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Burgess does a fine job explaining the structure and function of the human ankle, but for some reason takes its functioning as evidence that it was intentionally designed and not evolved. The human body is truly impressive, a point I repeatedly made in &lt;i&gt;Human Errors&lt;/i&gt;, but it also harbors abundant evidence of its long evolutionary past including, in my opinion, some examples of suboptimal functional design that are only comprehensible in the light of the limitations of evolutionary processes and our shared ancestry with other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have no idea why they chose to hyphenate (and weirdly capitalize) &lt;i&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/i&gt; [sic] when the perfectly serviceable word &lt;i&gt;Biocomplexity&lt;/i&gt; already exists, sans hyphen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Fair use claimed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Kitzmas was different. For the first time, the Discovery Institute allowed the anniversary of 
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District to pass without complaining about the verdict. Perhaps 
they are hoping that we will forget about the incredible badness of the text that they were 
trying to foist on the District’s students. &lt;em&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/em&gt; is carefully constructed to 
be as misleading as possible, and we shouldn’t let them forget this, as long as contributors 
and advisers responsible for it remain in position within the Discovery Institute&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while 
the Institute continues to promote  works such as Denton’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovery.org/v/legacy-of-evolution/?hilite=theory+crisis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolution – A Theory in Crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
that perpetuate the same elementary errors of logic.  But first, an apparent digression.  When 
students first come across the use of molecular or DNA sequencing in constructing phylogenetic 
trees, they are sometimes puzzled. They have been told that mammals are descended from fish by 
way of amphibians. Therefore, as a matter of common sense, they might expect that frogs should 
be closer to fish in evolutionary terms than we are. This is another example of the Evolution 
as Progress error. While amniotes have progressed through synapsid to mammal to humans, the 
pinnacle of creation, the frog has remained a lowly frog and should, therefore, be closer to 
the common ancestor, as if the ineluctable processes of molecular mutation had somehow been 
suspended.  We might call this the “frozen frog fallacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, a Table like the one shown below might help:
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/PandasTable1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Table of cytochrome c differences&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Table of cytochrome c differences, from &lt;em&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/em&gt;, Second edition. Fair use claimed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the multicellular organisms shown are, apart from small random fluctuations, at the same distance from the bacterium, as expected if they share a common ancestor distinct from bacteria, which have of course, independently, been accumulating their own set of changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the animals shown are, apart from small random fluctuations, at the same distance from wheat, as expected if they share a common ancestor distinct from plants. And the relative number of mutations shows that the split between plants and animals is more recent than the split between multicellular organisms and bacteria. More recent yet is the split between fish and tetrapods, leaving all tetrapods (including you and me, and of course present-day frogs) at the same distance from the fish. And so on. Most tellingly, humans share a common ancestor with monkeys, more recent than their common ancestor with non-simian mammals. There is a lot more detail in the Table, for example about how to birds relate to reptiles, and how the different orders of mammal relate to each other. And of course the construction of a phylogenetic tree is based on the specific differences found, rather than the overall number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now numerous published studies of the phylogenetic relationships revealed by Cytochrome C, to say nothing of the vast recent literature using numerous molecular and morphological traits to develop detailed high-resolution phylogenies, and to explore the limitations of the concept of a unique phylogeny. What is interesting about the particular Table I have quoted is its origin, and the uses that its authors make of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to our original theme. The Table actually comes from Of Pandas and People, 2nd edition, 1993, which by the time of the trial had gone through five printings. The book does not give a reference to the source of the data, but much (not all) of the information can be found in a classic 1967 paper [2], which also explains the reasoning behind the method, and critically examines the assumptions made. So there is no excuse for what the book does next, which is to repeatedly assert that the data refute claims of common ancestry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;one might expect analysis to reveal that the cytochromes in fish are most similar to the cytochromes in amphibians. But this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To use the classic Darwinian scenario, amphibians are intermediate between fish and the other band-dwelling invertebrates. Analysis of their amino acids should place amphibians in an approximately intermediate position, but it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note the use of Darwin’s name to denote the whole of evolution. In fact, the book is obsessed with Darwin, mentioning him on almost every page, and on some pages up to 10 times. In fact, by my count, and I may have missed a few, Darwin’s name or some variant of it occurs 262 times within the 144 pages of text. This emphasis on Darwin is of course found throughout the whole of the creationist literature, although by now evolutionary theory is almost as different from what Darwin proposed as atomic theory is from that proposed by Democritus.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just two of five separate reiterations of the fallacy, leading up to the extraordinary statement that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Based upon the evolutionary series, we should expect some amphibians to be closer to fish (“primitive” species) and others to be closer to reptiles (“advanced” species).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to make sure that the message sticks, we have this Figure, with the plain implication that the data point, not to evolution, but to separate creation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2023/PandasFig9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 9 from &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Of Pandas and People&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Figure 9 from &lt;em&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/em&gt;, Second Edition. Fair use claimed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fallacy is not merely being stated; it is being repeated, rationalised, and reinforced. The kindest explanation is that the authors simply do not understand the science that they are presenting, seeing a hierarchical structure where none exists, and imposing on their biology a perspective in terms of “higher” and “lower” which do not belong in modern science, but have been carried over, such as the power of human vanity, from a worldview more akin to Aristotle and the mediaeval Great Chain of Being. The same fallacy also occurs in Michael Denton’s 1985 Evolution - A Theory in Crisis, and while he had by 1998 [3] quietly walked away from this, his 2016 sequel, Evolution – Still a Theory in Crisis, retains his preference for Aristotelian over phylogenetic classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why should this matter? Because it reminds us, and we should not forget, that the Discovery Institute does not only deal in dis-information, but in dis-education.&lt;/p&gt;

I do not understand the James Webb Space Telescope in nearly as much detail, but I still consider it a miracle. &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; may not agree with my definition of a miracle, but they consider the telescope the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2022&quot;&gt;Breakthrough of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. Hard to argue with: the telescope itself is absolutely remarkable, as are some of the images it has returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;’s runners-up include perennial rice, the new-found creativity of artificial intelligence, deflection of an asteroid, two advances in virology – a nascent RSV vaccine and the discovery that multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus – and several others. What they call “Breakdowns” are fewer: the fact that zero Covid no longer works (if it ever did), the fact that science ties between nations are “fraying,” and the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions owing to the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers in Genesis posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/science/year-review-top-science-news-2022/&quot;&gt;Year in Review&lt;/a&gt;, by Troy Lacey, which they arranged chronologically by month, rather than in order of importance. A few comments below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their subhead reads, “From Giant Millipedes to Giant Pterosaurs, Looking Back at 2022 Science Stories.” Odd choices to highlight, I thought, and not a single mention of the James Webb Space Telescope. Perhaps they are afraid that it will demonstrate once and for all that the firmament is not a hammered-metal dome covering the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cite an article by Rob Webb, which discusses “rocket science through a biblical worldview” and include the following quotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;… Rocket Rob points out that precision, predictability, and order are all necessary for rocket science to work, and yet these things are unexplainable in a purely materialistic atheistic worldview. As Rob explained, “We expect the universe to be organized and to consistently obey the natural laws that make rocket science possible.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not the foggiest idea why an atheist [read: anyone who is not a biblical literalist à la Ken Ham] would not expect the universe to obey natural laws; indeed, it seems to me that biblical literalists who invoke miracles are the ones who do not expect the universe to necessarily obey natural laws.  Another odd comment discusses the not particularly new observation that Venus is not hospitable to life and notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Scripture doesn’t indicate that God assigned life forms on any planet or moon in the universe other than Earth. Venus would naturally be very different from Earth because it was prepared for a different purpose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That settles it then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIG is also impressed with the facts that a 35-million-year-old mayfly fossil looks very much like extant mayflies and that a clam long thought to be extinct is actually in existence today. They claim that “no ‘evolution’ [sic] had taken place in the supposed ~30 thousand years since the fossil clam had allegedly last lived.” Are the clams, for example, immune to the same viruses as they were 30,000 years ago? Or have they evolved immunity to newer pathogens? I doubt that anyone at AIG knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review seems strikingly devoid of anything you might call a breakthrough. But at least they got off a good pun: “In April, we disarmed the evolutionary story of how snakes may have lost their limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments? On the &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; article or the AIG article?

I do not understand the James Webb Space Telescope in nearly as much detail, but I still consider it a miracle. Science may not agree with my definition of a miracle, but they consider the telescope the Breakthrough of the Year. Hard to argue with: the telescope itself is absolutely remarkable, as are some of the images it has returned. Science’s runners-up include perennial rice, the new-found creativity of artificial intelligence, deflection of an asteroid, two advances in virology – a nascent RSV vaccine and the discovery that multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus – and several others. What they call “Breakdowns” are fewer: the fact that zero Covid no longer works (if it ever did), the fact that science ties between nations are “fraying,” and the increase in CO2 emissions owing to the war in Ukraine. Answers in Genesis posted a Year in Review, by Troy Lacey, which they arranged chronologically by month, rather than in order of importance.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we are at the last day of 2022, the newspapers are full of accounts of what happened in 2022.  Even the Discovery Institute has bragged, at its site &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/12/the-year-in-review-intelligent-design-grows-in-influence-and-depth/&quot;&gt;Evolution News &amp;amp; Science Today&lt;/a&gt;
how much the cause of Intelligent Design advanced in the last year.  This account, by Brian Miller, was mocked by critics of ID (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/30/the-enduring-futility-of-intelligent-design-creationism/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/id-achievements-of-the-year/15635&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/01/01/follow-up-on-id-at-conferences/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to come up with lists of things that happened in 2022.  But much easier to make lists of things that didn’t happen.  I wondered: what are the major things 
that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; happen in 2022?  Particularly with regard to arguments for Intelligent Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll provide my suggested non-event.   It is the clarification of how the Algorithmic Complexity argument for Intelligent Design works.  It remains, as it has been 
for some years, basically unexplained.  A reading of the whole course of argument using Specified Complexity, from William Dembski’s book &lt;em&gt;The Design Inference&lt;/em&gt; on, 
shows that the algorithmic complexity calculation started out as a peripheral suggestion and gradually changed until it is now said to be central to that 
argument.  But in the course of these changes, the logic of the criterion became no clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I puzzled over this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html&quot;&gt;perhaps at too great a length&lt;/a&gt; in a post here at Panda’s Thumb.  Was the algorithm supposed to compute the genotype?  the phenotype? 
Why was observation that it was nonrandomly un-complex supposed to favor ID?  How did the probability distribution of algorithms that was used make biological sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed, and none of these questions have been answered.  So I nominate this non-event as the greatest non-achievement of Intelligent Design proponents 
in 2022.  I congratulate them.  But our readers may have other non-achievements to suggest.  Let’s hear from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Faraday_Institute_Results_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Survey results&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerry Coyne on his blog today advises us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/29/take-the-faraday-institutes-science-vs-religion-quiz/&quot;&gt;Take the Faraday Institute’s Science vs. Religion quiz!&lt;/a&gt; So I did! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencereligioncompass.org/&quot;&gt;(Here.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may see my result to the left. I ended up in the fourth quadrant, relatively close to the y-axis. The axis labels are to some extent jargon: Functional means that religion is best at social activities, what Dr. Coyne and I would call “tikkun olam,” or “repairing the world.” Substantive, by contrast, means that religion has meaning or content. The terms on the x-axis are reasonably clear, but I consider scientism to be pejorative and wish they had found a better term. (I have more than once been accused of scientism and am somewhat gratified that I did not land farther to the right.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what the quiz makers said about me, and it is fairly accurate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Science is true, but religion has some value”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For you, science is the only (or main) way to the truth and religion is only really a cultural phenomenon, so the two can get on just fine. But you’re likely to add an important caveat to this: the two can get on just as long as religion doesn’t try and make any truth claims and sticks to what it does best – building community and helping others. When it comes to the job of understanding reality, it has nothing important to contribute. If you’re here, your temperature is probably a bit cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty good, and they are certainly correct that I think religion gets into hot water when it makes truth claims. I have no objection to religious beliefs that do not tread on scientific fact, though I do not hold such religious beliefs myself. I came out a little lower on the thermometer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Faraday Institute also provided an estimate of where the great scientists of history may end up on their graph, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could quibble with some of the placements, but it was interesting that I find myself below Darwin, Heisenberg, and Huxley. Dr. Coyne is a more militant atheist than I am, and he ended up in the first quadrant, about where Bohr appears, and farther than I would have expected from the “New Atheists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Worthen lets William Dembski get the last word. We have criticized Dr. Dembski seemingly endlessly on this blog, but here I think he’s got it essentially right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe in miracles, but I think they require scrutiny,” Dr. Dembski told me [Dr. Worthen]. “I don’t tend to see things as flamboyant as in the New Testament.” He published a moving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/first-person-faith-healing-wheres-the-evidence/&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; of his family’s disappointment at a healing revival, where he sought prayer for his autistic son. “There can be quite a bit of self-delusion on the part of people looking for miracles, and it troubles me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dembski’s family has learned to look for the miraculous in everyday loving encounters, like when a teacher’s aide made it her mission to help his son learn to use the bathroom on his own. “His life is so much better because of this person who wouldn’t give up on him,” he said. “It was no miracle, in terms of a magic wand that touched him and everything was fine. It was people who were willing to love him and do the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dembski says he believes in miracles. Or perhaps gives lip service to a belief in miracles. What happened when it got down to brass tacks, as when he took his autistic child to the so-called faith healer? The supposed healer refused to see the child because he did not “look the part”; Dr. Dembski saw right through faith healing and indeed recognized it as “self-delusion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider a miracle to be a figure of speech for when, say, that teacher takes his son under her wing, does the very best she can with him, and, against the odds, succeeds. Dr. Dembski professes a belief in literal miracles, but seems more impressed with practical, figure-of-speech–type miracles.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breakthrough-for-intelligent-design-part-7&quot;&gt;Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 7)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 13, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Lars Jon Erkell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the article published?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article is embarrassing for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. One could expect the journal to take drastic measures to try to restore its damaged reputation. Like withdrawing the article, firing the responsible editor and blacklisting the reviewers responsible for the scientific review. But they didn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, they let the article stand and published a disclaimer from the journal’s management. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments in bona fide universities). We were unaware of this fact while the paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords “intelligent design” were added by the authors after the review process during the proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors. We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the editors distance themselves from ID as such, and say that they did not understand that it was about ID because the keyword “intelligent design” was added by the authors only after the article had been reviewed. That is a strange statement. Firstly, because the editors would not have understood that it was about ID. It is enough to glance quickly through the text to recognize familiar ID themes such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity or Dembski’s explanatory filter. If you happen not to recognize such markers, you should ask yourself what in the world this is all about, and check it out. Failure to understand that this is about creationism/ID shows ignorance and carelessness on a level that is inexcusable for a scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I believe that it is wrong to reject an article solely for the reason that it deals with ID. It could (theoretically) happen that someone actually managed to find good scientific arguments for ID, and then they should of course be published. That would be a sensation. But, as we saw in the previous post, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have not managed to show anything at all. The statistical method they want to introduce is useless, and consequently they have no results. The article should not have been accepted for publication for the reason that it has no scientific interest. Added to this is all the pseudoscience the article contains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why didn’t the journal retract the article, and why did they write this strange disclaimer? &lt;!--more--&gt; One reason may be that the publisher that owns the Journal of Theoretical Biology, Elsevier, has had bad experiences with retracting articles related to ID. A well-known ID proponent, the mathematician Granville Sewell, had an article in 2011 titled “A second look at the second law” accepted by Applied Mathematical Letters, also owned by Elsevier. When the editor realized that the work was pseudoscientific, it was retracted. Sewell sued the journal, and the dispute ended with the publisher being forced to pay $10,000 and to publish an apology. They probably don’t want to do this again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how did Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article even get through the review process? One possibility is, as I said, ignorance and carelessness on a level that is unforgivable for a scientific journal. Another could be that the authors may have taken advantage of the opportunity that some journals offer, to suggest suitable reviewers themselves. If they then suggested ID-friendly people, and the editor didn’t bother to read the work, the article may have gone under the radar. Then the editor may have been ID-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements of scientific integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update-for-pandas-thumb&quot;&gt;Update for Panda’s Thumb&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the publication of this post in 2020, new
information about the review procedure has surfaced. In
the article “Creation-based research advances the
positions” &lt;a href=&quot;https://genesis.nu/i/artiklar/skapelsebaserad-forskning-flyttar-fram-positionerna/&quot;&gt;(Skapelsebaserad forskning flyttar fram positionerna)&lt;/a&gt;, 
published on the website of
the Swedish creationist association Genesis on the 9th
of July 2021, we can read this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the review process, the journal’s editors and
reviewer advised the authors to tone down the references
to Intelligent Design (ID) and replace it with the term
“fine-tuning”, including in the title of the article, which was
done. On the other hand, they had no objection to a
discussion of ID, as well as criticism of neo-Darwinism,
provided that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer also referred to
sources critical of ID. For this reason, the authors judged
in connection with the final proofreading that it would be
relevant to have “intelligent design” as one of the key
words for the article. The word “intelligent” was then
deleted by the responsible editor (see below); still the
word “intelligent” is considered too sensitive in contexts
like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, in the talk “Creation-based research in a
secular research world” &lt;a href=&quot;https://genesis.nu/video/skapelsebaserad-forskning-i-en-sekular-forskarvarld-ola-hossjer/&quot;&gt;(Skapelsebaserad forskning i en sekulär forskarvärld)&lt;/a&gt; given at the annual
meeting of the Swedish creationist association Genesis
in 2021, Ola Hössjer confirms this picture at 27:37:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we first submitted the article, we included
“Intelligent Design” in the title as well. The editor and
reviewers were positive but they said replace ID with
fine tuning in the title and abstract but you can keep
evolution criticism later in the article and mention ID,
and the article was, to my own surprise, published,
but there were many people who contacted and
wanted the article retracted. The editors were under
a lot of pressure, so they were forced to write a
disclaimer saying we disavow all research in ID, and
it has come to our attention that the researchers are
associated with creationist groups. But they did not
remove the article and that was the most important
thing for me, so it remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the editors and the reviewers were
complicit in smuggling the article through the review
process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is more. A post titled “Editors say they won’t
retract intelligent design paper despite subject being
‘not in any way a suitable topic’ for their journal” &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/15/editors-say-they-wont-retract-intelligent-design-paper-despite-subject-being-not-in-any-way-a-suitable-topic-for-their-journal/&quot;&gt;(here)&lt;/a&gt; at the website Retraction Watch points out that
Steinar Thorvaldsen failed to disclose a conflict of
interest when he did not disclose that he was the
chairman of the board in the ID-promoting foundation
BioCosmos. A foundation that had recently received a
$1.6 million grant. According to the guidelines of J.
Theor. Biol., this would have been a cause for
retraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;end-of-update&quot;&gt;End of update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what will be the answer to the question if Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article is a breakthrough for Intelligent Design? It depends on who you ask. For the Discovery Institute and the ID movement, it is a success to have an ID-friendly article published in a high-ranking scientific journal. The publication makes it easier to present ID as a scientifically legitimate theory, something that is valuable in public opinion work. At the same time, the journal’s disclaimer provides an opportunity to present the ID movement as a victim and to complain that they are being discriminated against by the “Darwinists”. They go so far as to compare the journal’s treatment of the article to the Nazis’ treatment of the Jews. The Swedish association Genesis sees the critique as a serious attack on academic freedom and illustrates their article with a photo that appears to come from a concentration camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a scientific point of view, the article does not represent any scientific breakthrough for the simple reason that it contains no results. Just a useless statistical model. And that makes perfect sense; ID is not a scientific project, and it cannot produce any scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment by Ola Hössjer&lt;/strong&gt; June 29, 2021 4:12 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7: Why was the fine-tuning article published?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last and concluding part of his series of articles, Erkell asks
himself how our article could be accepted by a reputable journal. I find
no reason to comment on Erkell's speculations about the reasons why
TH2020 was published. I am content with the fact that the article was
evaluated according to the usual peer review procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pondering the reasons why TH2020 was published, Erkell arrives at the following conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context one may ask – which are the basic requirements for
scientific integrity are? Based on Erkell’s first six articles, it is not
difficult to guess that scientific integrity for him means that science
must follow the principle of methodological naturalism. In other words,
Erkell demands that all science should be conducted on a secular basis.
On the contrary, for my part I believe that the editors showed a great
deal of integrity when, despite a storm of criticism from evolutionary
biologists, they held on to their decision to publish the article. This,
as I see it, is a healthy sign that gives good hope for the future of
science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions from parts 1-7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I welcome examination and scrutiny of the research articles I
wrote, both constructive criticism and appreciation. In this context, I
would like to take the opportunity to mention that not all scientists
seem to have the same attitude as Erkell towards the article that I wrote
with Thorvaldsen. After TH2020 was published, I co-authored a follow-up
article on the time it would take for evolution to bring about major
genetic changes. This paper has recently been published and I have been
invited to give a talk on its findings at an international conference
with many well-known participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the introduction, I want to thank Lars Johan Erkell for
actually taking the time to read, not only the article on fine-tuning
that I coauthored with Steinar, but also several of the articles we refer
to. If time permits, I am happy to continue this exchange of ideas,
through articles or debates. However, I believe that much of Erkell’s
criticism misses the point. First, Erkell has misunderstood what
Intelligent Design or creationism means by assuming that such research is
governed by non-falsifiable criteria. Secondly, Erkell makes a feather
out of a chicken when he criticizes us for using the word &quot;non-physical
information&quot;, because he did not understand what we meant by this term.
Third, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism
is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary it is
based on a materialist starting point. By using methodological
naturalism, Erkell thus wants to force all research to be guided by
secular assumptions. For my part, I advocate a scientific environment
where secular, design-based, creationist and other hypotheses are allowed
to participate and be tested on equal terms. I leave it to the reader to
judge whether my approach or Erkell's is the more democratic one and the
one that best matches the purpose of science to seek the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to the question of how TH2020 came to be published in J. Theor.
Biol. I, and many with me, have been surprised by the matter. You write
above that the article has been reviewed &quot;according to the usual peer
review procedure&quot;. The picture you get of the process in the article
&quot;Creation-based research moves the positions forward&quot;, which the
association Genesis published on its website on July 9, is a completely
different one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the review process, the journal’s editors and reviewer advised the authors to tone down the references to Intelligent Design (ID) and replace it with the term ‘fine-tuning’, including in the title of the article, which was done. On the other hand, there were no objections to a discussion of ID, as well as criticism of neo-Darwinism, on the condition that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer also referred to ID-critical sources. For that reason, the authors judged in connection with the final revision that it would be relevant to have “intelligent design” as one of the keywords for the article. The word “Intelligent” was then deleted by the responsible editor (see below); the word ‘intelligent’ is still considered too sensitive in contexts like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have the explanation why the article could be published: ID-
friendly editors. That the journal's editors and reviewers advise the
authors to avoid sensitive phrases in order to go under the radar and
thus be able to violate the journal's policy is not a &quot;customary&quot;
procedure. It is also confirmed by the disclaimer that was published.
Your claim that this was a &quot;customary peer review procedure&quot; is therefore
not true, if the article on the website of the association Genesis is to
be believed. I am inclined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to my regret that the journal does not live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity. You write “Based on Erkell’s first six articles, it is not difficult to guess that for him scientific integrity means that science must follow methodological naturalism as a principle”. No, this has nothing to do with naturalism. It is about the fact that a scientific journal should not publish material that does not meet reasonable requirements for scientific rigor, thereby giving it legitimacy. For me, this means in this case that you don’t publish material where you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;claim that you have shown something when you have not actually done it. The reader who is not attentive (or knowledgeable enough) is deceived.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;present an unusable method as if it were useful. Again, you can fool the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give the impression that concepts that are not established and well defined, such as “specificity” and “non-physical information” would actually be solid and defined. This means that the reasoning can give the impression of being rigorous when in fact the concepts are so blurred that they do not make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;do not discuss weaknesses in your own model. The most glaring weakness in this case is the enormous (and by all accounts insurmountable) difficulties in calculating the probability that a structure would be designed by a non-material designer, something that is not mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have manipulated quotations in the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you suggest that much of my criticism misses the mark for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, Erkell has misunderstood what Intelligent Design or creationism means, in that he assumes that such research is governed by non-falsifiable criteria”. To that I answer both yes and no. I make an attempt to clarify the problem in the post “Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, Erkell makes a chicken out of a feather when he criticizes us for using the word “non-physical information”, because he did not understand what we mean by this concept”. It is quite true that I do not understand what you mean by “non-physical information”. And that is because you yourselves do not seem to understand what you mean - you do not even attempt a definition. The only thing you come up with is a vague reference to “semantic information”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary is based on a materialist belief. By using methodological naturalism, Erkell wants to force all research to be guided by secular assumptions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an echo of Phillip Johnson’s argument that methodological naturalism is in fact philosophical naturalism in disguise. It’s not.  Methodological naturalism is literally methodological, it is about how to work in a practical way to obtain reliable research results. But ID research (to the extent that it exists at all) has not produced a single concrete result in more than 20 years (please correct me if I’m wrong). This is because there are no practically working methods for “design detection” - all there is, is reasoning about how one might do it. TH2020 is another example of thais.  And because ID research does not work in practice, it is not seen as scientifically interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to democracy. You and Steinar Thorvaldsen have published an article
here that openly argues for ID in J. Theor. Biol., an established
scientific journal. You obviously have full freedom to devote yourself to
ID within the framework of your professorships. The same goes for your
fellow professors Michael Behe, Stuart Burgess and Scott Minnich, to
mention three names that come to mind at the moment. So obviously you are
allowed to work with ID, and you can publish in the scientific press. But
of course you have difficulty getting research grants, and that's not so
strange - a completely ordinary, secular, research program that hasn't
produced any results for more than 20 years wouldn't get a penny either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You write that you are happy to continue our exchange of ideas through
articles or debates. That was nice, I do too, but I’m not particularly
interested in debates. A written exchange with judicious arguments, like
the one we have now, gives much more. And these are important questions
we have to address: what is legitimate science, and where are the limits
of science?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lars Johan Erkell (with comment by Ola Hössjer)</name></author><summary type="html">The text is a pun in Swedish: &quot;Logg&quot; means something like a ship´s log or a logbook. A blog is &quot;blogg&quot;. So &quot;Biolog(g)&quot; is a biologist´s log or blog. This is part 7 of a series of 7 posts by Lars Johan Erkell, with comments on each by Ola Hössjer and a reply by Erkell. Part 1 will be found here. They are translations of 2020 posts in Swedish from the Biolog(g) blog of the Department of Biology of Gothenburg University, responding to an article by Steiner Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer titled “Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems” in Journal of Theoretical Biology Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 7) November 13, 2020 by Lars Jon Erkell Why was the article published? The publication of Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article is embarrassing for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. One could expect the journal to take drastic measures to try to restore its damaged reputation. Like withdrawing the article, firing the responsible editor and blacklisting the reviewers responsible for the scientific review. But they didn’t do that. Instead, they let the article stand and published a disclaimer from the journal’s management. It reads: The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments in bona fide universities). We were unaware of this fact while the paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords “intelligent design” were added by the authors after the review process during the proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors. We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Here the editors distance themselves from ID as such, and say that they did not understand that it was about ID because the keyword “intelligent design” was added by the authors only after the article had been reviewed. That is a strange statement. Firstly, because the editors would not have understood that it was about ID. It is enough to glance quickly through the text to recognize familiar ID themes such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity or Dembski’s explanatory filter. If you happen not to recognize such markers, you should ask yourself what in the world this is all about, and check it out. Failure to understand that this is about creationism/ID shows ignorance and carelessness on a level that is inexcusable for a scientific journal. Secondly, I believe that it is wrong to reject an article solely for the reason that it deals with ID. It could (theoretically) happen that someone actually managed to find good scientific arguments for ID, and then they should of course be published. That would be a sensation. But, as we saw in the previous post, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have not managed to show anything at all. The statistical method they want to introduce is useless, and consequently they have no results. The article should not have been accepted for publication for the reason that it has no scientific interest. Added to this is all the pseudoscience the article contains. So why didn’t the journal retract the article, and why did they write this strange disclaimer?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Martian meteorite</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/12/martian-meteorite.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Martian meteorite" /><published>2022-12-19T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-12-19T12:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/12/martian-meteorite</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/12/martian-meteorite.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph supplied by &lt;strong&gt;Dan Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
