&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evolutionary biologists argue with creationists or 
advocates of Intelligent Design about the effectiveness 
of natural selection, the biologists often use the example of 
artificial selection.  And almost invariably, the 
ID advocate or creationist tries for a “gotcha” by 
saying “but artificial selection is an example of 
intelligent design, and is nothing like natural 
selection!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to go into why this is not a “gotcha” 
but is a mistaken analogy on their part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial selection is a very old practice, dating 
back to inadvertent selection when wild animals wwere 
domesticated, with the wildest ones being eaten or chased 
away, or they successfully escaped.  With the start of 
agriculture, farmers often bred from their best animals 
(or plants).   Charles Darwin paid close attention to 
the ways animals had been changed by breeding, both for 
food production or as pets.  He was particularly attentive 
to the reesults of pigeon breeding. “Natural selection” was named 
in analogy to artificial selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-design-is-in-design&quot;&gt;How much design is in Design?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that artificial selection is Intelligent Design is 
wrong because plant and animal breeders, until very recently, 
had no detailed understanding of the genomes of their 
organisms or how to make detailed changes in the genomes to 
affect the phenotype.  All they could do was to choose who 
to breed from, based on their phenotype (such as the amount 
of beef produced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century this got more sophisticated, but was still 
not Intelligent Design.  Real statisticians got involved, and 
selection was based on numerical indices computed from multiple 
characters.  I remember visiting a poultry breeding operation 
and hearing how they measured 10 characters, including not 
just the production characters but such important traits as 
susceptibility to viral disease.  This was in the 1970s, and 
they had a modest mainframe computer in their offices, with 
databases of traits.  It was the natural outcome of work in 
the 1930s and 1940s by quantitative-genetics-inspired animal 
breeders at such centers as Iowa State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they did not know the detailed genetics of these traits. 
The selection still depended on observing the traits and not 
directly knowing any of the genetics, or much about the 
developmental biology of the traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-to-intelligent-design&quot;&gt;On to Intelligent Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 2010s animal and plant breeding was entering a new 
era, though with difficulty.  In 2014 I was invited to give 
a talk (on natural selection) in Vancouver BC, at the 10th World 
Congress of Genetics Applied to Livestock Production.  I was 
talking about the mathematics of natural selection.  It was 
apparent from the muted audience response that this was now of lesser 
interest to people working on livestock production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead the hot topic of the Congress was QTLs – “quantitive trait 
loci” – how could they find individual genes whose alleles 
affected the production traits and disease resistance traits. 
If these could be found, they could be used by screening potential 
parents of the next generation, and maybe even by genetically 
engineering their genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that lots of effort is now going on towards 
entering this new era of genomics should be enough to make it clear 
that even thousands of years of animal and plant breeding, 
with lots of human intelligence applied, is not the same as 
Intelligent Design.   So the success of that history of breeding does 
say a lot about it as exemplifying the power of selection, 
without genetic engineering or even understanding the effects 
of changes in genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-comparable-example&quot;&gt;A comparable example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that another similar flawed critique is 
when creationists and ID advocates argue that the success 
of Genetic Algorithms in solving engineering problems is 
irrelevant, because that is an example of Intelligent 
Design.  It isn’t, if the algorithm has random mutations, 
random recombinations, and random mating, with fitnesses based 
on the final phenotypes rather than on detailed knowledge 
of how they were achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ID books such as Robert Marks, William Dembski, and 
Winston Ewert’s “Introduction to Evolutionary Informatics” there 
is a great effort to show that in simulations of 
natural selection, they only succeed because the design 
information is built in.  For example, in Richard Dawkins’s 
famous teaching example of the “Weasel”, the target phrase 
is part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in other cases, such as Dave Thomas’s genetic algorithm 
for a Traveling Salesman problem (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/target-target-w-1.html&quot;&gt;his 2006 post here at 
Panda’s Thumb&lt;/a&gt;
) no particular solution is built in.  All Marks, Dembski and 
Ewert could do was point to places where some fine-tuning of 
the algorithm had been made to make it more successful, but 
this is not the same as building in the answer to the particular 
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So neither the success of animal and plant breeding, nor 
the success of genetic algorithms, can be sensibly attributed 
to Intelligent Design of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">by Karl Wagner, from a major German encyclopedia, Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Volume 19, published in 1909 in Leipzig.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronaut Barry “Butch” Wilmore is an ardent supporter of Answers in Genesis. Captain Wilmore is stuck, possibly until next year, on the International Space Station (ISS) because of concerns with the safety of the Boeing Starliner capsule. Apparently, Ken Ham will get tons of publicity from support by astronaut Wilmore, who can be seen wearing an Ark Encounter T-shirt and hat in the photo. Captain Wilmore has also taken separate photos of two different Ark baseball caps on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ham is already hawking “as seen in space” merchandise promoting the Ark &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/08/30/as-seen-in-space/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These “as seen in space” items are available on our online store or at the attractions.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a fun way to promote the Ark and talk about a man who is bold in his witness for Jesus Christ and the truth of God’s Word from the very first verse, even while working as an astronaut with NASA.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to send a payload to the ISS is about $10,000/lb, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-and-marketing-pricing-policy/&quot;&gt;according to NASA&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it was probably much more expensive to send anything on the ill-fated Boeing Starliner. If the T-shirt weighs about 5 or 6 oz and the two caps combined weigh a similar amount, then the cost of getting them into orbit was around $8,000. Although NASA allows astronauts to have personal items, both NASA and the International Space Station have explicit guidelines for advertising.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-brand-center/advertising-guidelines/&quot;&gt;NASA’s guidelines&lt;/a&gt; appear to explicitly forbid Wilmore’s advertising for Answers in Genesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Advertising and Marketing on the International Space Station &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Commercials and other marketing filming/activity on the International Space Station authorized by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/s1701746119060610280_1.pdf&quot;&gt; NASA Interim Directive (NID) on Use of International Space Station (ISS) for Commercial and Marketing Activities&lt;/a&gt; are additionally subject to the following guidelines: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NASA support in filming/capturing commercials or other marketing videos, which will occur behind the scenes, shall not be used to indicate or imply that NASA approves or endorses the requesting entity or its products, services, or enterprises. No commercials or promotional materials filmed on ISS may imply such approval or endorsement, nor may NASA stock images or footage be used in a way that does so. … &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/1214.403&quot;&gt;rules for the ISS crew&lt;/a&gt; state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ISS crewmembers shall refrain from any use of the position of ISS crewmember that is motivated, or has the appearance of being motivated, by private gain, including financial gain, for himself or herself or other persons or entities. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Wilmore certainly gives the appearance of promoting the for-profit Ark Encounter and the non-profit Answers in Genesis ministry at US taxpayer expense. Ken Ham will probably make a lot of money off the shirt and cap sales. I predict that NASA and the ISS will ignore this apparent violation of their own rules to avoid negative publicity and pushback from AIG’s supporters. Mr. Ham and AIG once again triumph in getting a benefit from the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Phelps</name></author><summary type="html">Screenshot showing AIG products worn by astronaut Barry Wilmore in the International Space Station.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/geology/how-long-have-arches-been-around/&quot;&gt;How Long Have Arches Been Around?&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;. Danny Faulkner, describes creationist “research” into geomorphology. It is laughably bad, even for creationists. Natural arches and bridges are aesthetically interesting, but are only a tiny part of some geomorphology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this piece, Dr. Faulkner* extrapolates backward to “show” that arches in Arches National Park, Utah, have formed since Noah’s Flood, about 4,500 years ago. He claims this timeframe because of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biblical literalism. Employees of Answers in Genesis must sign a &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/&quot;&gt;Statement of Faith&lt;/a&gt; that posits that the earth and universe are 6,000 years old, and that most geology is a result of Noah’s Flood, approximately 4,500 years ago. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An exponential rate of arch collapse.  Faulkner states he doesn’t use a linear decline in numbers of arches because no arches would remain after 4,500 years. No consideration is given to the possibility of much longer time scales, or changes in climate and erosion rates. Change in regional climates over time is ignored, possibly because the young earth creationists at AIG cram the nearly 2 million years of Pleistocene glacial maxima into a single ice age of only 200 years after the Flood. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, AiG uses this denial of the Pleistocene to also ignore evidence for past climate changes and the evidence scientists use to support anthropogenic climate change in the present. Faulkner has invented his model by assuming that an exponential model is the best for arch collapse, and then he fits things assuming the rate is 43 arches in 29 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, his scholarship is abysmally shoddy. Conceivably, it would be possible to make a plot of cumulative arches lost vs. time. This would be a more accurate method for modeling. However, Faulkner just assumes the loss rate was constant (a cumulative arches-vs.-time chart would show the accuracy of that assumption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also seems to assume that the collapse of arches in Utah is related solely to the minerals cementing the sandstone that the arches are formed from. He doesn’t document any effort to examine records to see if any collapses were associated with long term climate changes, intense storms, seismic events, vandalism, and innumerable other possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faulkner also assumes a uniform rate of arch formation. He then uses his model and that assumption to show that, in his view, there would have been an implausible number of arches if the Earth were as old as earth scientists claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All his equations are a smoke screen, an appeal to look like scientific research when religious apologetics is what is actually being presented. In short, this is a parody of how science is actually done. The 4,500 year time frame and the Flood are required by AIG’s  peculiar version of a “Biblical Worldview,” which is more than a bit of a science stopper and a weird excuse to start with creationist conclusions and work backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faulkner oddly discusses Kentucky arches in Red River Gorge in addition to Arches National Park, but cannot do a similar calculation for the Kentucky arches, as arch collapse here in Kentucky has not been documented. The reported observations in Kentucky are another smoke screen in the article, basically a non sequitur. The discovery/documentation rate of arches in Kentucky has no bearing on their rate of formation or collapse (and the same holds for Utah).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faulkner’s apparent assumption of the evolution of arches from formation to collapse is naive. Surely, the height, span, and dimensions of the suspended material are factors to consider. Not all arches are formed in the same fashion: some are formed by wind or water erosion; some by collapse. Not all arches are in the same topographic position: some are isolated and exposed on points; some are parallel to cliff faces. The relationship to and importance of natural fracturing differs among arches. If Dr. Faulkner considered these factors, he didn’t document his efforts. Our assumption is that he was unaware of these complications or deliberately chose to ignore them (and didn’t document why he did so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonscientific method used by Answers in Genesis “researchers” results in the publication of materials that don’t reflect reality very well; yet AiG’s conclusions are held by millions of our fellow citizens. Faulkner’s piece is a &lt;i&gt;dazzle-them-with-sciency-sounding-stuff faux research that confirms AIG and their audience’s preexisting biases&lt;/i&gt;. The public deserves better. It should be part of our job as earth scientists to do a better job of explaining science to the public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

Detail of photograph by Mike van den Bos on Unsplash. This article, How Long Have Arches Been Around?, by Dr. Danny Faulkner, describes creationist “research” into geomorphology. It is laughably bad, even for creationists. Natural arches and bridges are aesthetically interesting, but are only a tiny part of some geomorphology studies. In this piece, Dr. Faulkner* extrapolates backward to “show” that arches in Arches National Park, Utah, have formed since Noah’s Flood, about 4,500 years ago. He claims this timeframe because of Biblical literalism. Employees of Answers in Genesis must sign a Statement of Faith that posits that the earth and universe are 6,000 years old, and that most geology is a result of Noah’s Flood, approximately 4,500 years ago. An exponential rate of arch collapse. Faulkner states he doesn’t use a linear decline in numbers of arches because no arches would remain after 4,500 years. No consideration is given to the possibility of much longer time scales, or changes in climate and erosion rates. Change in regional climates over time is ignored, possibly because the young earth creationists at AIG cram the nearly 2 million years of Pleistocene glacial maxima into a single ice age of only 200 years after the Flood.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Buteo lineatus</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/08/buteo-lineatus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Buteo lineatus" /><published>2024-08-19T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-08-19T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/08/buteo-lineatus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/08/buteo-lineatus.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Ole Lundin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The original title of this article, borrowed (as you may infer) from Ken Ham, was &quot;Here's What People NEED To Know about Ken Ham.&quot; That title now seems too cute and did not seem to give the article much traction, so we have taken the unusual step of changing it to the present, more descriptive title. The URL remains the same. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ken Ham, on a YouTube video entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1aGZoJCdCpo?si=8iLpBwawPiOYOYbE&quot;&gt;Here’s What People NEED to Realize about Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;” and specifically credited to Answers in Genesis, explicitly attacks Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris for her views on abortion and other matters. The video received around 150,000 views in a day or so. AIG writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this short video, Ken Ham speaks on the recent political ideologies of Kamala, sharing his perspective on them as a Bible-believing Christian.&quot; [Note how he infantilizes her by using her first name only.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our colleague Dan Phelps, who sent us this link, asks, “How is AIG, a ministry, still tax exempt?” He notes that AIG’s shell company, Ark Encounter, gets $1.825 million per year in sales tax rebates from Kentucky Tourism and is advertised for free by the taxpayer-supported “Kentucky Faith Trail.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps suggests that you can complain to the IRS using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf&quot;&gt;Form 13909, Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint (Referral)&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear whether the IRS will take any action, but a few complaints cannot hurt. AIG’s street address is Answers in Genesis, 2800 Bullittsburg Church Rd., Petersburg, KY 41080, and their EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is 33-0596423.  You need to send a cover letter along with the form, but both may be e-mailed to the address at the bottom of page 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS form asks you for “Who/What/Where/When/How you learned about and obtained the information in this report.” I do not know precisely what approach to take, beyond that Mr. Ham runs a tax-exempt religious organization, which he considers a ministry, and in this video he is implicitly campaigning against Kamala Harris. Perhaps this line of reasoning can be fleshed out in the comments to this post. The URL of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGZoJCdCpo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you have the illusion that Mr. Ham is not electioneering, I can assure you that his minions think otherwise. Consider, for example, these (admittedly cherry-picked) comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have had four years of warning. It’s time to vote her OUT!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thanks Ken for being bold enough to say the truth about this election. Glory be to God in the Highest!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can barely stand to listen to her. God help us all if she gets to be president.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &quot;It’s time the we Christians vote politicians like this out of office and keep them out of our political arena..&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I pray EVERY Christian goes out and votes this November. Pray and Vote. We cannot tolerate this evil any longer. Thank you AIG for making things so clear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A majority of the comments merely pray for our lost souls and whatnot, but comments such as these clearly show that many, if not most, listeners recognize Mr. Ham’s true intention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Ken Ham on YouTube assuring us that a fertilized egg is a human being.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knew? I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia&quot;&gt;aphantasia&lt;/a&gt;, the inability to visualize things. Well, probably not fully fledged aphantasia, but certainly &lt;i&gt;dys&lt;/i&gt;phantasia. Aphantasia is a word I first learned on listening to an NPR program with a somewhat lengthy title, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/06/26/1198910315/face-blindness-prosopagnosia-memory-aphantasia-sight-imagination&quot;&gt;The human brain is hardwired to recognize faces. But what if you can’t?&lt;/a&gt; It turns out that Sadie  Dingfelder, the author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316545147/&quot;&gt;Do I Know You? A Faceblind Reporter’s Journey into the Science of Sight, Memory, and Imagination&lt;/a&gt;, can’t. Recognize faces, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Dingfelder is not only face blind; she is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoblindness&quot;&gt;stereo blind&lt;/a&gt; and aphantasic. Now, I understand that freshman psychology students think they suffer from every affliction they study, but I was surprised to find that I have some degree of all of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was stereo blind until a dozen or two years ago. Indeed, I remember commenting to the eminent lens designer Rudolf Kingslake that I saw no difference between one eye and two. He was astonished and told me everything popped into life with two eyes open. I in turn was baffled. (I must have had some stereopsis, because I found that, when I looked at a painting or photograph with one eye, I saw more depth than with two eyes, presumably because the clue that the painting was flat was missing without the stereopsis afforded by two eyes. This technique, which was taught to me by a photogrammetrist at the University of Guelph, is very useful when walking around art galleries.) Many years later, while engaging in eye exercises for something else, I suddenly developed what I think may be fairly good stereo vision, and it has never gone away, even after I quit the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that I first learned of face blindness, or &lt;i&gt;prosopagnosia&lt;/i&gt;, from Oliver Sacks’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/man-who-mistook-his-wife-hat&quot;&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/a&gt;. According to the NPR report, Ms. Dingfelder is almost completely face blind, more so than almost anyone else. After reading Sacks’s book, I realized that I too have a degree of face blindness – I suppose I could say prosop&lt;i&gt;dys&lt;/i&gt;gnosia, but that would be a dreadful word. At any rate, although I have never accused anyone else’s spouse of buying junk food, as did Ms. Dingfelder, I have a lot of trouble recognizing people I have just met or know only slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for aphantasia, I can visualize things but not well. Possibly that is one reason I do not like fiction that is heavy with description. The apple I am visualizing right now is merely a hollow, transparent shell. I can see the stem, the black sepals at the blossom end, and the core, but the skin has no color, and the flesh has no texture, if it exists at all. I think probably this inability to visualize is why I cannot draw objects with curves very well, and faces are out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sadie-dingfelder/do-i-know-you/&quot;&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, Ms. Dingfelder has amblyopia, or lazy eye, which I presume is the origin of her stereo blindness (unless, of course, it is the other way around). Kirkus says that as a result of her stereo blindness she cannot get around easily, walk on uneven surfaces, or drive a car. Either Ms. Dingfelder or Kirkus partly misunderstands depth perception. We have depth perception even with one eye; it is just not as good as stereo vision. In Colorado, for example, you may drive as long as your vision in one eye is 20/40 or better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds as if the book is part memoir and part science, rather like this essay. I have not yet read it, but I intend to do so as soon as I can manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 1.&lt;/strong&gt; An appendix is a vestigial part of a document and has no known function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 2.&lt;/strong&gt; While writing this essay, I was reminded of an anecdote told to our class by my philosophy professor, Murray Turbayne. Professor Turbayne relates asking his mother-in-law to visualize an apple. I forget the exact order, but, roughly, he asks her to imagine that it has no color. OK, no color. No smell or taste. OK. No weight. OK. No texture. A little harder, but OK. What is left? The apple! We then had a discussion, which I only dimly remember, about whether the apple was more than the sum of its attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Who knew?
