&lt;p&gt;Lately, the Discovery Institute’s ID site Science and Culture has had almost 
no arguments that would convince any scientist that Intelligent Design 
contributed to the diversity of life.  Michael Behe’s arguments are the 
same as before, and William Dembski’s latest versions of his specified 
complexity argument leaves out any discussion of why having a large 
value (of his Algorithmic Specified Complexity) cannot be achieved by 
ordinary evolutionary processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at S&amp;amp;C they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; getting a bit angry at evolutionary biologists. For 
stealing credit that belongs to ID advocates.  A post on December 12, 
is titled “All the Evidence Points to Design, but the Credit Goes to … You Know What”. 
Even more remarkably, its author is “Science and Culture”.  This makes it 
an official statement by the site.  Or else none of their people want to 
take credit or blame for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They simply point to an article at BioEssays on “spatiotemporal cues in 
cell division”, in particular to its last paragraph, which contains the 
sentence (boldface text is S&amp;amp;C’s emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why evolution selected chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt; as a platform to integrate different signals 
is easily explained by the need to concentrate mitotic regulators (and their control) 
which would otherwise dilute in a vast cytoplasmic ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and S&amp;amp;C’s comment is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, William Dembski said that one of the most objectionable aspects of modern evolutionary theory was the undeserved, unearned credit it steals from the exquisite, transcendentally elegant work of the Designer. Put more bluntly, evolution is a credit thief, a lowdown sleazy embezzler. If we could personify evolution, we’d have ChatGPT make a drawing of the word as a convict with a prison serial number across its chest.
But if you just put your thumb over the word “evolution” in the phrase we highlighted, all the evidence for design is still there, and it’s just too cool for words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, all the wonderful details of biological systems must be evidence for Intelligent Design, 
it’s so obvious that they figure anyone can see this.  If a biologist lapses into 
teleological language that personifies evolution, this must mean they acknowledge 
that Design Intervention happened, but are too scared to admit it, and give credit to 
a personified Evolution instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the matter can be looked at another way …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary biologists would mostly not bother to pay attention, 
but those that did would notice that S&amp;amp;C is impressed by 
lots of phenotypes and behaviors that are the result of natural 
selection.  They would notice that the BioEssays article yields 
to an unfortunate temptation to personify natural selection, in 
a burst of enthusiasm at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to who is stealing credit, it is clear that S&amp;amp;C is.  But this

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 29, Answers In Genesis apologist and astronomer Danny Faulkner posted an article on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Dr. Faulkner’s article sensibly dismissed popular speculation (including persistent claims by Harvard professor Avi Loeb) that 3I/ATLAS and similar objects might be artificial probes or alien artifacts. But in doing so, Faulkner never addressed the only question that is cosmologically relevant for a young-earth framework: Where did this object come from? Interstellar comets are not curiosities or distractions; they are kinematic probes: natural test cases for any model purporting that the universe is only a few thousand years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an organization that claims to be able to give “Answers” about what they call “origin science”, Answers In Genesis is suspiciously quiet about the origins of interstellar comets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-third-interstellar-comet&quot;&gt;The Third Interstellar Comet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the rise of wide-field astronomical surveys, astronomers have kept a vigilant watch on the skies for near-Earth objects (NEOs): asteroids and comets whose orbits may bring them close to the Earth, with potential risk of impact. But beyond planetary defense, surveys also catalog a broad variety of small bodies because these minor objects carry clues about the formation and evolution of planetary systems: their orbits, compositions, and dynamics help scientists trace back when and how they formed, and how stable their source systems remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comets in our solar system come in different flavors. Short-period comets have orbits closely bound to the Sun, often returning every few years or decades, typically originating in the Kuiper Belt or closer. Long-period comets have highly elongated but still bound orbits, often taking thousands or millions of years to complete (usually thought to arise in the distant Oort Cloud). Both of these types remain gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit with very different orbital periods. A third, much rarer category — hyperbolic or interstellar comets — follows an unbound trajectory. Their eccentricity exceeds 1, placing them on a one-time pass through the Solar System: they arrive from interstellar space, swing past the Sun, and then depart forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the world encountered only the third such confirmed interstellar visitor. The first was 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in October 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov, announced in August 2019. The newest, 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered this July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. Follow-up observations soon confirmed its extremely hyperbolic orbit. Because 3I/ATLAS is active (i.e., showing a fuzzy coma and dust tail, like a “normal” comet) astronomers treat it as a genuine cometary body, not a rocky asteroid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faulkners-cosmological-commitments&quot;&gt;Faulkner’s Cosmological Commitments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Danny Faulkner has become the predominant AIG author and speaker on issues of astronomy since the departure of Dr. Jason Lisle some years ago, writing on topics ranging from light-travel-time and starlight problems to extrasolar planets, dark matter and dark energy, planetary system formation, and the operation of modern astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope. Over the years, he has articulated a reasonably consistent set of commitments in his elucidation of a “Biblical” cosmology. In defense of a recent special creation, he has argued that divine creation is characterized by stability and order, even using this perceived order as evidence for divine design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two years ago, while explaining the evidence for dark matter, Faulkner wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creationists have long advanced the idea that there is design and stability in the world. For instance, some creationists speak about the stability of both planetary orbits and the orbits of the planets’ natural satellites, and even the stability of systems beyond the solar system. Which is it? Did God create a stable world, or did He create an unstable world? Are creationists willing to sacrifice the stability argument in favor of a lesser argument for relatively recent origin?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Science progresses only when we change and develop our models as new data are found. Rather than ignoring or denying the data that are invoked in support of dark matter and dark energy, recent creationists must produce their own models to interpret this data. Only through this difficult process can significant progress be made in achieving a robust, truly biblical cosmology/cosmogony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faulkner treats this concept of a stable, orderly universe as a foundational theological principle. This theme recurs throughout Faulkner’s popular writings, lectures, and technical papers, where orbital regularity, galactic coherence, and the long-term persistence of planetary systems are repeatedly cited as marks of divine design cutting against the perceived “chaos” of stellar evolution. Stability is not merely descriptive in his framework; it functions as a theological constraint on cosmological interpretation: a necessary feature of a created universe that must remain physically intelligible rather than dynamically deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, comets have long been held up by creationists as part of their broadly-debunked suite of “evidences” for a young earth. Faulkner has frequently argued that because active comets lose material with each solar passage, a population persisting over millions or billions of years would require continuous replenishment, something he claims has never been convincingly demonstrated. Instead, he maintains that the observed numbers of comets are best explained by recent creation, with gradual depletion through sublimation and gravitational scattering accounting for their observed fading. Similar arguments appear across AiG publications, where both short-period and long-period comets are presented as transient populations inconsistent with deep time and therefore evidence for a young solar system — arguments that explicitly rely on the physical loss and ejection of comets as natural dynamical processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Comets have little mass, so each close pass to the sun greatly reduces a comet’s size, and eventually comets fade away. They can’t survive billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Two other mechanisms can destroy comets—ejections from the solar system and collisions with planets. Ejections happen as comets pass too close to the large planets, particularly Jupiter, and the planets’ gravity kicks them out of the solar system. While ejections have been observed many times, the first observed collision was in 1994, when Comet Shoemaker-Levi IX slammed into Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given the loss rates, it’s easy to compute a maximum age of comets. That maximum age is only a few million years. Obviously, their prevalence makes sense if the entire solar system was created just a few thousand years ago, but not if it arose billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these commitments form a coherent cosmological picture. Comets originate as real members of real star systems. Gravitational processes can eject them from those systems. After ejection, these bodies travel under ordinary Newtonian mechanics. Their motions are real and physically meaningful, not illusory or metaphorical. Crucially, nothing in Faulkner’s published framework permits comets to materialize mid-flight or exist without physical origin. Their histories, at least in principle, should be observationally tractable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-creationist-cosmology-predicts&quot;&gt;What Creationist Cosmology Predicts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Faulkner takes his own worldview seriously, he has to acknowledge that interstellar comets carry direct and testable implications. Any such object must originate from a previously existing stellar or planetary system that formed part of God’s stable created order. Once ejected, its motion through space becomes a straightforward problem of classical kinematics. Velocity multiplied by time yields a maximum travel distance. Trajectories point backward to source regions. Each interstellar comet should therefore act as a natural tracer pointing toward the location of its parent system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a genuine 6,000-year cosmology, the implications are clear. Because Faulkner’s universe is so young, any object traveling at tens of kilometers per second could only have come from a very small local neighborhood around the Sun. Unlike scientific cosmology—which recognizes that the galaxy and universe are billions of years old—young-earth models compress physical possibility into an extremely confined volume of space. Interstellar comets, rather than being awkward anomalies, should therefore become some of the most powerful discovery tools available to creationist astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-physics-of-3iatlas&quot;&gt;The Physics of 3I/ATLAS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physics of 3I/ATLAS are simple and uncontroversial. Its perihelion velocity was measured at approximately 68.3 kilometers per second. Combining that value with the object’s hyperbolic eccentricity allows computation of its hyperbolic excess velocity, the speed it had when effectively outside the Sun’s gravitational influence. This velocity is about 58 kilometers per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on a very generous 6,000-year timescale, an object traveling at that constant speed could traverse only about 10^13 kilometers: just under 1.2 light-years. This figure establishes a firm upper bound: under young-earth cosmology, any natural parent system for 3I/ATLAS must lie within a sphere extending less than 1.2 light-years from Earth, and the comet’s incoming trajectory must align with that location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know, however, that no such star systems are presently catalogued. Proxima Centauri, Alpha Centauri, and Barnard’s Star—the nearest known stellar neighbors—lie at distances several times that limit, and none align with 3I/ATLAS’s observed arrival direction anyway. Within Faulkner’s framework, therefore, 3I/ATLAS could not plausibly have originated from any known star system. This realization should drive young-earth cosmology to an obvious and specific prediction: there must exist one or more yet-undiscovered star systems, brown dwarfs, or massive planetary bodies within 1.2 light-years of Earth lying along the comet’s trajectory that served as its point of ejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If creationists adhered seriously to their own cosmology, this conclusion would be exhilarating rather than inconvenient. Each interstellar comet would provide a geometric “search cone” on the sky defining where the undiscovered parent object must lie. Reducing the universe to a 6,000-year age compresses the allowed volume so tightly that the relevant search zones become modest and tractable. Modern infrared surveys, and especially the James Webb Space Telescope, are capable of detecting extremely faint stellar and substellar objects that earlier instruments might have missed. Creationists should be pressing for dedicated sky surveys in the predicted regions, attempting to identify their missing neighbors before secular astronomy stumbles across them incidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success would be a spectacular triumph: direct empirical confirmation of a major young-earth prediction. That is the essence of scientific testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-expanding-pattern&quot;&gt;An Expanding Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictive pressure strengthens when the earlier interstellar visitors are included. 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov entered the solar system with even lower excess velocities than 3I/ATLAS, meaning that under young-earth time limits they must have originated from even closer parent systems than 3I/ATLAS requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 1I/ʻOumuamua, with a hyperbolic excess velocity of roughly 26.3 km/s, even a full 6,000-year transit would limit its origin to a distance of about 0.55 light-years, and its steep orbital inclination of 122.7° places its incoming direction far from alignment with any known nearby stellar system. For 2I/Borisov, traveling somewhat faster at approximately 32 km/s, the maximum 6,000-year travel distance increases only to around 0.65 light-years, with its 44° inclination likewise incompatible with the directions of known nearby stars. In both cases, the required parent systems would need to lie even closer to the Sun than the hypothetical source implied by 3I/ATLAS — within fractions of a light-year along their respective inbound trajectories — yet no such stellar or substellar objects are known to exist in those regions of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky volume of possible sources for 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov therefore becomes smaller still. Under a functioning young-earth research program, these objects should already have yielded a growing catalog of predicted nearby systems awaiting observational confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet nothing of the sort exists. No sky-cone analyses have been published. No target fields have been identified. No JWST proposals have been announced. No predictions have been offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theological-retreat&quot;&gt;Theological Retreat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this sort of silence is not all that surprising. Pursuing these predictions would almost certainly lead to failure, and that failure would constitute a direct and visible refutation of young-earth cosmology. Instead, the problem of origin is quietly avoided altogether. If pressed, Faulkner would likely be forced to argue a nonsensical origin: the comet did not come from anywhere; it was simply created already traveling through space, with a trajectory tracing back toward a nonexistent point of origin, like a real bullet fired from an imaginary gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation is not a theoretical lifeline—it is an intellectual collapse. Faulkner has insisted that cosmic stability and lawful dynamics testify to the Creator’s design. “Created in transit” abandons those commitments. If moving bodies are not products of physical histories but fabricated with fictitious kinematics, then trajectories cease to encode past motion. Velocities become meaningless numbers with no historical content. Astronomy itself loses any capacity to infer origins or causes. Every observation can be dismissed as a specially arranged appearance, immune to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interstellar comets offer perhaps the most direct empirical test yet available for young-earth cosmology. If its advocates truly believed their claims about cosmic stability, real celestial mechanics, and comets originating within star systems, they would treat objects like 3I/ATLAS as opportunities for bold prediction. Instead, these opportunities are ignored, because serious engagement would expose the model to decisive risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with young-earth astronomy is not that it makes incorrect predictions. It is that it refuses to make predictions at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Dan Phelps for calling attention to Faulkner’s silence on the origins of interstellar comets and to the University of Kentucky’s Dr. Thomas Troland for discussions on the kinematics of comet ejection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But beyond planetary defense, surveys also catalog a broad variety of small bodies because these minor objects carry clues about the formation and evolution of planetary systems: their orbits, compositions, and dynamics help scientists trace back when and how they formed, and how stable their source systems remain. Comets in our solar system come in different flavors. Short-period comets have orbits closely bound to the Sun, often returning every few years or decades, typically originating in the Kuiper Belt or closer. Long-period comets have highly elongated but still bound orbits, often taking thousands or millions of years to complete (usually thought to arise in the distant Oort Cloud). Both of these types remain gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit with very different orbital periods. A third, much rarer category — hyperbolic or interstellar comets — follows an unbound trajectory. Their eccentricity exceeds 1, placing them on a one-time pass through the Solar System: they arrive from interstellar space, swing past the Sun, and then depart forever. In 2025, the world encountered only the third such confirmed interstellar visitor. The first was 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in October 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov, announced in August 2019. The newest, 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered this July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. Follow-up observations soon confirmed its extremely hyperbolic orbit. Because 3I/ATLAS is active (i.e., showing a fuzzy coma and dust tail, like a “normal” comet) astronomers treat it as a genuine cometary body, not a rocky asteroid. Faulkner’s Cosmological Commitments Dr. Danny Faulkner has become the predominant AIG author and speaker on issues of astronomy since the departure of Dr. Jason Lisle some years ago, writing on topics ranging from light-travel-time and starlight problems to extrasolar planets, dark matter and dark energy, planetary system formation, and the operation of modern astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope. Over the years, he has articulated a reasonably consistent set of commitments in his elucidation of a “Biblical” cosmology. In defense of a recent special creation, he has argued that divine creation is characterized by stability and order, even using this perceived order as evidence for divine design.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Spider with box elder bug</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/11/spider-with-box-elder.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spider with box elder bug" /><published>2025-11-24T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-11-24T12:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/11/spider-with-box-elder</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/11/spider-with-box-elder.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2025/Schilthuizen_Darwin_Comes_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this fascinating book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Comes-Town-Jungle-Evolution/dp/1250127823&quot;&gt;Darwin Comes to Town: How the Urban Jungle Drives Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, by the biologist Menno Schilthuizen of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the University of Leiden. Years ago, probably about when it appeared in 2001, I read Prof. Schilthuizen’s equally fascinating book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Frogs-Flies-Dandelions-Speciation-Evolution/dp/0198503938&quot;&gt;Frogs, Flies, and Dandelions&lt;/a&gt;, about the origins and definitions of species (indeed, the difficulty of defining species at all). So naturally I snapped up &lt;i&gt;Darwin Comes to Town&lt;/i&gt;. The title is a pun, in that the book is about the evolution of organisms that have either adapted to cities or towns, or have adopted cities or towns. I will not review the book, but will pen 3 or 4 paragraphs about chapters that for one reason or another especially interested me. If you want more, read the book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first organism that Schilthuizen describes in detail is a &lt;i&gt;Culex molestus&lt;/i&gt; mosquito that he discovers in the London Underground. Outside the Underground, evidently the mosquito feeds on birds, has an interesting sex life that involves large swarms, and also hibernates. Inside the Underground, it has learned to feed on humans, “seek [its] sexual pleasures in confined spaces,” and not hibernate. Its genes spread from city to city, presumably by plane, train, or car, and it interbreeds with its above-ground relatives. All this happened, Schilthuizen assures us, very recently, probably only since humans began digging tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was still reading the book, I came across a very short article in a &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; magazine newsletter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aed2501&quot;&gt;Cultivating a pest&lt;/a&gt;, by Corinne Simonti. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Yuki Haba et al. recently reported that, contrary to what Schilthuizen has written, these mosquitoes, which they call &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; form &lt;i&gt;molestus&lt;/i&gt;, have a much longer association with us humans, and probably date back to the ancient Middle East. As I was reading these references, I cattily wondered how a biblical literalist, for example, would have responded if such a well-established “fact” had been disestablished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, in 2005, I became something of a minor expert on the peppered moth and posted an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://skepticalinquirer.org/2005/03/moonshine-2/&quot;&gt;Moonshine: Why the Peppered Moth Remains an Icon of Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, with my colleague Ian Musgrave (who deserves all the credit for the &lt;i&gt;Moonshine&lt;/i&gt; title; you may have to read the article to learn why). A short chapter, Urban Myths, told the story of the peppered moth clearly and concisely, including the “controversy” instigated by the journalist Judith Hooper. Hooper’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moths-Men-Evolutionary-Tale/dp/0393051218&quot;&gt;Of Moths and Men: An Evolutionary Tale&lt;/a&gt;, was, in Schilthuizen’s words, well-researched, but then without evidence she accused an important moth researcher, Bernard Kettlewell, of fraud. Musgrave and I took up her claims and showed that Hooper did not understand the vagaries of fieldwork in biology and almost without doubt Kettlewell had not committed fraud. Unfortunately, our paper was not published in a technical journal (I frankly do not remember why not), and Schilthuizen was unaware of it; I thought perhaps he might otherwise have been harder on Hooper. (Incidentally, for a discussion of creationists’ response to the case of the peppered moth, see the article by Paul Braterman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2013/08/creationism-as-conspiracy-theory-the-case-of-the-peppered-moth.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is lots more in this book, but I want to get to the last part, where Schilthuizen discusses exotic or non-native species. He suggests, frankly, that they are here to stay and that eventually all cities will have very similar floras and faunas because they are intertwined by modern transportation. This contention leads him to the conclusion, which many will find contentious, that we might as well give in, embrace non-native species and even plant them when it seems appropriate. As a person who passionately hates field bindweed (&lt;i&gt;Convolvulus arvensis&lt;/i&gt;), I will be curious to know what others think of his proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, reader’s last inch: I thought the book was uncommonly well written and used anecdotes such as his own interactions with the experts to great advantage. Not once that I recall was I bored or thought he should get on to the next topic already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Prof. Schilthuizen recommended to me his latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Naturalist-Make-Scientific-Playground/dp/0262049090&quot;&gt;The Urban Naturalist: How to Make the City Your Scientific Playground&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last April and is sort of a sequel.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Institute’s website “Science and Culture” (formerly Evolution 
News and Views) had a dramatic story of conversion recently.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandculture.com/2025/10/he-taught-darwinism-for-decades-then-changed-his-mind/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; entitled “He Taught Darwinism for Decades (Then Changed His Mind)” by
Andrew McDiarmid on 30 October 2025.  It announced that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For decades, British professor and author Neil Thomas was a card-carrying Darwinist. It wasn’t until after he retired from academia that he had the repose to think about things objectively. 
Then one day, in a scientific flash of inspiration, he came to the conclusion that the standard Darwinian story was “rubbish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that Neil Thomas has written two books, published by 
the DI’s publishing outfit, Discovery Institute Press:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1637120036&quot;&gt;Taking Leave of Darwin: A longtime Agnostic Discovers the Case for Design&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/False-Messiah-Darwinism-That-Failed/dp/163712080X&quot;&gt;False Messiah: Darwinism as The God That Failed&lt;/a&gt;.  He has also 
made numbers of posts at Science and Culture since 2021, see them &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandculture.com/author/nthomas/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  He was intervewed in a 
two-part (&lt;a href=&quot;https://idthefuture.com/2127/&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://idthefuture.com/2128/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;) series by Jonathan Witt in 2021 and by Andrew McDiarmid in 2025.
in the DI’s series “ID The Future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas cannot understand how biologists ever believed Darwin’s mechanism of natural 
selection.  So: has someone who has been devoted to teaching biology students about 
Darwin and natural selection recently changed his mind?  If so, should we pay close 
attention to his arguments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well …
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hasten to say that I have not read these two books, though I have listened to the 
two podcast interviews.  In the podcasts, Thomas expresses his scepticism about 
the origin of Life, and about whether natural selection can account for the 
complexity of humans.  But he does not explain why natural selection cannot account 
for adaptations of biological organisms once life has arisen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a couple of the arguments Thomas uses against “Darwinism”.  First, McDiarmid 
quotes Thomas as saying “This Darwinism business, it’s rubbish isn’t it?”  And he summarizes 
Thomas’s argument, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, Thomas criticizes Darwin’s cardinal principle of natural selection as intellectually incoherent and empty of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then he continues with Thomas’s conclusion that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the term essentially refers to preservation; it is conservative, cannot create, and certainly cannot select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pratts&quot;&gt;PRATTs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are two PRATTs (Points Refuted A Thousand Times).  They are truly “moldy 
oldies”.  The first seems to be the assertion that “survival of the fittest” is meaningless 
because fitness is defined as having survived.  In reality, the moment we compare 
phenotypes or genotypes to see which have the higher fitness, fitness is meaningful 
and not a vacuous concept.  I am not the first to make this point, but for more 
explanation &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/12/Fitness-Tautology.html&quot;&gt;see my 2020 post on this here at PT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for “preservation”, if there are more than one genotype in the population, 
and one is preserved more than the others, then it will increase in 
frequency.  So the composition of the population can change, particularly 
if the genotype(s) “preserved” are not the most frequent ones.  Again, the 
idea that natural selection cannot change the population is a PRATT, and 
again, I have heard it enough times that I joined the many people who 
have refuted that argument.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/06/diexperts.html&quot;&gt;my 2023 post here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Neil Thomas seems to have little understanding of how natural 
selection works.  That would be shocking if he were teaching “Darwinism” 
for many years, as a biologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-a-biologist&quot;&gt;Not a biologist!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Neil Thomas is not a biologist.  Not even close.  This is no 
secret: in his biographical material at S&amp;amp;C News, which appears 
at the end of each of his posts there, he is described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Neil Thomas is a Reader Emeritus in the University of Durham, England and a longtime member of the British Rationalist Association. He studied Classical Studies and European Languages at the universities of Oxford, Munich and Cardiff before taking up his post in the German section of the School of European Languages and Literatures at Durham University in 1976. There his teaching involved a broad spectrum of specialisms including Germanic philology, medieval literature, the literature and philosophy of the Enlightenment and modern German history and literature. He also taught modules on the propagandist use of the German language used both by the Nazis and by the functionaries of the old German Democratic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;useful-but-not-new&quot;&gt;Useful, but not new&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should add that Thomas spends most of his posts at S&amp;amp;CN 
describing the intellectual atmosphere preceding and during 
publication of Charles Darwin’s books.  He points to many 
predecessors, going back to the Greeks and Romans, and concludes 
that Victorian society was ready for a secular explanation 
of how adaptation could come about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is right about that, but his point is hardly new.  There is 
some implication in Thomas’s posts that “Darwinists” have 
insisted that Darwin was the first evolutionary thinker.  That 
is totally wrong: there have been numerous books, for decades 
exploring Darwin’s predecessors.  Stephen Jay Gould had many 
columns on the subject.  There is an extensive Wikipedia page 
on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought&quot;&gt;History of Evolutionary Thought&lt;/a&gt;.
Peter Bowler’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-History-Idea-Anniversary-Preface/dp/0520261283&quot;&gt;Evolution, the History of an Idea&lt;/a&gt;,
is a good summary.  We have also posted yearly celebrations of 
Lamarck, Darwin’s most important predeccessor &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/08/HappybirthdayLamarck.html&quot;&gt;here at Panda’s 
Thumb&lt;/a&gt;, 
the most recent also discussing Lamarck’s predecessor and 
patron Georges Buffon.  These posts will be found on or near August 1 of 
each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particular favorite of mine is an older popularization 
by John Greene, provocatively titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Adam-Evolution-Western-Thought/&quot;&gt;The Death of Adam: Evolution and Its Impact on Western Thought&lt;/a&gt;.
It points out the connection between the major advances in other 
fields, such as astronomy, which led to a search for 
unifying mechanisms, even in biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas seems most upset about this change, the rise to 
dominance of secular science which searches for 
mechanisms in our everyday world.  He seems to think 
that recent arguments by the Discovery Institute are 
invalidating this.  He’s welcome to his opinion, but 
I don’t think his arguments will bear much weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">  The Discovery Institute’s website “Science and Culture” (formerly Evolution News and Views) had a dramatic story of conversion recently.

I did not especially like the term, “survival of the fittest,” when I think he really meant “natural selection.” My first impression was that he may have been conflating origin of life with evolution, though they are certainly closely related. He kind of pushes the selfish gene theory, but also states some criticisms and states flatly that genetic drift can sometimes overcome natural selection. He notes that his model is an oversimplification, but then, as he says, all scientific models are oversimplifications. I will let a real biologist discuss whether evolution takes place at the level of the gene, the individual, or indeed the group. As for me, I thought it was a splendid video which in a half-hour or so gave a clear understanding of how life can develop from non-life and go on to evolve into, well, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful, several of which make cameo appearances in the video.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I am going to step out of my lane again and tout this video, Something Weird Happens When You Simulate Lifeless Molecules, by Veritasium.
