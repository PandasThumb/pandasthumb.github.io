&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that, in Kentucky, at least, “inclusive” means “Christian.” At least, that is what you might deduce from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/2023/12/08/what-is-the-kentucky-faith-trail/71842251007/&quot;&gt;article by Jolene Almendarez and
Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez&lt;/a&gt; in the Cincinnati &lt;i&gt;Enquirer&lt;/i&gt; late last year. The article announces the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentuckyfaithtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Kentucky Faith Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which is a self-guided road trip that will take you to 11 important faith-based sites, all of them Christian.* The program has received a $305,000 grant from the state. Its purpose, according to a press release of the northern Kentucky tourism organization, as paraphrased by the &lt;i&gt;Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;, is to “pay homage to the role religion plays in Kentucky’s identity.” It is also designed to promote religious tolerance and understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trail is designed to be inclusive, welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to embark on a shared journey of discovery and reflection[.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org&quot;&gt;Freedom from Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (FFRF) will have none of it. In an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/43493-don-t-promote-ark-encounter-and-creation-museum-ffrf-asks-state-of-kentucky&quot;&gt;Don’t promote Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, FFRF asks state of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, FFRF notes that all 11 sites are Christian sites, a fact which hardly makes the trail welcoming to people of all faiths and backgrounds. Worse, they note that two of the sites, “the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, are well known for spreading misinformation and promoting anti-science worldviews[.]” Here at PT, where we are perhaps more forthright, we would say they spread &lt;i&gt;disinformation&lt;/i&gt;, which is to say, deliberate misinformation. Additionally, unlike most of the others, they have no historical value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FFRF goes on to describe these two “museums” and notes that they are owned by Answers in Genesis (AIG), which they accurately describe as “an extreme evangelical Christian organization that spreads misinformation and scientifically inaccurate teachings about our world.” Homing in on AIG, they stress that the Northern Kentucky Convention &amp;amp; Visitors Bureau “must cease using taxpayer money to promote a Faith Trail that includes the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum” and conclude that “[b]y promoting exclusively Christian sites, including two sites that spread blatant misinformation, the Bureau is unconstitutionally favoring Christianity over all other faiths.” You may see the complete letter to the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org/uploads/files/Northern%20Kentucky%20CVB%2C%20KY%20LTR2.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I am no great fan of mallard ducks (we have almost as many as we have Canada geese, but at least they seem to be housebroken). This one, a male, must have had especially clean, new feathers, because he clearly shows the green, iridescent coloring on his head. That is, the coloring is not due to pigment, but rather interference colors owing to layering in the feathers. You can tell because the color faces you, but is absent elsewhere. Mallards also show bluish iridescence farther back, but that is not visible in this picture. Like many things, the green head looks better in life than in a photograph, but a photograph is the best I can do.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the floatless Ark seen from the rear. &lt;small&gt;Photograph by Dan Phelps.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Braterman reported earlier that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/Martyn-Iles-Is-Executive.html&quot;&gt; Martyn Iles is the new Executive CEO of Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Braterman found the appointment of Mr. Iles troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Iles was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/01/martyn-iles-is-new-ceo-of-creation-museum-ark-encounter/72004202007/&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; the other day by Jolene Almendarez of the Cincinnati Enquirer. I will admit that I was slightly put off by Ms. Almendarez’s first comment, that “most” reputable scientists and educators debunk AIG’s “controversial” claims about the age of the earth and so on. Nevertheless, it was a good interview which asked pertinent questions – though I fear that it will make Prof. Braterman no less troubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of Mr. Iles’s remarks. In response to a question about how AIG will change under his leadership, he said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; So it used to be that the main argument raised by the culture to say Christianity is false is that evolution is true. I just don't think that's where we are anymore. We're much more into social issues about climate change, racial issues, LGBT issues, all that kind of stuff. ... [ellipsis in original] So there's kind of a broadening of the message ….&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the usual conflation of Christianity with Mr. Iles’s bizarre brand of evangelical Christianity, we see the expansion into “social issues” that troubled Prof. Braterman. And well it should. In case you wonder just what kind of person we are dealing with, I will anticipate the last sentence in the article, which claims that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Iles has also supported controversial rugby player Israel Folau, who posted online “drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolators” would go to hell if they don't repent, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; reported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the interview. Regarding climate change, Mr. Iles assured us that climate change would not destroy the world; rather, God would do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: When do you think the world will be destroyed by climate change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: (Laughs) My philosophy is that God will destroy it first. God has a plan for the world, and it will exist until he's done with it. ... I mean, we could do some damage in the meantime, don't get me wrong, but we're not going to completely destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: That's the most optimistic perspective I've ever heard about climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: (Laughs more) There's a lot of optimism in this message, I've got to tell you. It all ends well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am certainly relieved to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed answer to a question, Mr. Iles stressed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message will include anything that is introduced in the book of Genesis – this includes race, climate change, family, sexuality, gender, (all LGBTQ issues) [parentheses in original], identity, life, truth, the problem of evil, political power, and others. Many contemporary topics.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more, including plans to introduce digital technology such as virtual reality. But I will leave that to read for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">A view of the floatless Ark seen from the rear. Photograph by Dan Phelps.

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading, intermittently, I afraid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JBJS1MF/&quot;&gt; An Immense World&lt;/a&gt;, subtitled “How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,” by Ed Yong. The book is about senses: vision, touch, pain, hearing, taste, smell, but also heat, vibration, electric and magnetic fields, and echoes and echolocation. I am about up to the part where he tries to tell you, with a sort of apology to Thomas Nagel, what it is like to be a bat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I heard Mr. Yong interviewed by Arielle Duhaime-Ross last week on Science Friday, under the title, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/an-immense-world-umwelt-animals/&quot;&gt;Expanding our Umwelt: Understanding animal experiences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Umwelt&lt;/i&gt; is a German word that Mr. Yong borrows to mean “the part of [its] surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; ran an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/animals-vision-video.html&quot;&gt;A bird’s-eye view of a Technicolor world&lt;/a&gt;, by Emily Anthes. This article shows some videos supposedly demonstrating what the world might look like to a bird whose vision is sensitive to ultraviolet light. There seemed to be an implicit assumption that ultraviolet looked a lot like violet and the birds see the primary colors about the same as we do, but never mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am supposed to know something about optics and even a little bit about vision. I once read Ivan Schwab’s monumental work &lt;i&gt;Evolution’s Witness: How Eyes Evolved&lt;/i&gt; cover to cover and discussed it on Panda’s Thumb, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/07/evolutions-witn.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Yet in the chapter on vision I learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;that a certain kind of jumping spider has a Galilean telescope in each of 2 eyes and can see about as acutely as a dog. Its retinas are weird, but you will have to read the book to find out how. The field-of-view of each telescope is greatly limited, but that is OK because the spider has 4 other eyes to work with;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;that birds of prey have 2 foveas, one for tracking prey and one for looking at the horizon;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;that a certain microbe sports an eye that uses a reflecting mirror instead of a lens, all in a single cell (I showed a picture of a single-celled microbe that contained a focusing lens in the article on Prof. Schwab's book, so the concept of a microbe with an eye was interesting but not entirely shocking).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the book on a Kindle Paperwhite, which gives a black-and-white image. A photographic gallery was lumped at the back of the book and not particularly good in black-and-white, so I had to go to a computer to look at them. Except for, I think, 2 embedded figures, none was called out in the text, so you could not easily link the photographs back to the appropriate portion of the text. Additionally, I hereby lodge my perennial complaint about endnotes: Each chapter had countless endnotes, and most contained interesting and important information. Indeed, I learned about the foveas of birds of prey in an endnote in a chapter about bats and of the microbe with the reflecting mirror in another endnote. All of that material should have been worked into the text. If I had had a hard copy of the book – a codex – and had to shuffle back-and-forth 20-odd times in a given chapter, my Umwelt would have been greatly disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; article is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002444&quot;&gt;Recording animal-view videos of the natural world using a novel camera system and software package&lt;/a&gt;, by Vera Vasas, &lt;i&gt;et&lt;/i&gt; 14 other &lt;i&gt;alia&lt;/i&gt;, Plos Biology, January 23, 2024. I have barely glanced at the article and will likely not read it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I have been reading, intermittently, I afraid, An Immense World, subtitled “How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,” by Ed Yong.

&lt;figcaption&gt; Morning reflections of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinopah_Mountain&quot;&gt;Sinopah Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (8,271 ft) and Paradise Point, eastern shore of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Medicine_Lake&quot;&gt; Two Medicine Lake&lt;/a&gt;, Glacier National Park, Montana. Also visible on horizon (L-R) are Painted Teepee (7,850 ft); Two Medicine Pass, Sinopah Mountain, Mt. Helen (8,538 ft) and Dawson Pass. The purple/maroon tints of these mountains are colored by mudstones and argillites in the Appekunny and Grinnell Formations (Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup, ~1.4 Ga). These formations are also a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Overthrust&quot;&gt;Lewis Overthrust&lt;/a&gt; structure of the Rocky Mountain front range in Northern Montana.

The WV News noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to WV Public Broadcasting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wvpublic.org/lawmakers-hear-support-for-intelligent-design-in-public-schools/&quot;&gt;two high school students&lt;/a&gt;, Haden Hodge and Hunter Bernard, argued that intelligent-design creationism is not a religious argument. Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps, who is from Kentucky and has been fighting this kind of nonsense for years, adds, “Let us hope that this doesn’t spread to Kentucky; our legislature would fall for ID creationism very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears as though the answer to the initial question, “Is intelligent-design creationism making a comeback?” may be a qualified “Yes.” Specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/catalyzing-action/sign-ncse-monitor&quot;&gt;NCSE Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly newsletter published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/&quot;&gt; National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, today noted several “intelligent design” bills besides those in West Virginia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/maines-problematic-proposed-revisions-science-standards-under-fire&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;: A proposal to encourage middle school &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; teachers to teach about genocide, eugenics, and the Holocaust. Maybe we should &quot;encourage&quot; middle school history teachers to teach evolution. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/mandatory-intelligent-design-bill-oklahoma&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;: A Senate bill to require public or charter school teachers to teach &quot;the concepts of creationism and/or intelligent design&quot; if they teach evolution. NCSE points out that teaching &quot;intelligent design&quot; has been deemed unconstitutional by a Federal court because it is a religious view [quotation marks in original]. Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/two-intelligent-design-bills-oklahoma&quot;&gt;similar bills&lt;/a&gt; have been prefiled in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/west-virginias-former-intelligent-design-bill-passes-senate&quot;&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;: According to NCSE, the Senate bill has passed and now states that &quot;[n]o public school board, school superintendent, or school principal shall prohibit a public school classroom teacher from discussing or answering questions from students about scientific theories of how the universe and/or life came to exist.&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
