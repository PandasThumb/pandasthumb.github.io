&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.masterbooks.com/climate-change-for-kids-and-parents-too&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids…and Parents Too!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest entry in a spate of climate change denial books aimed at a young audience, invites the reader to “[d]elve into the science of climate change and discover how science, removed from assumption and speculation, reflects the history and truth found in God’s Word” (in the words of the back cover). The reference to God’s Word is distinctive: the propaganda efforts in the same vein from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/11/CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-coalition-climate-denial/&quot;&gt;the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Huckabee’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31072023/huckabees-kids-guide-to-climate/&quot;&gt;EverBright Kids&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/articles/in-desantis-fla-schools-get-ok-for-climate-denial-videos/&quot;&gt;PragerU&lt;/a&gt; are ostensibly secular. But the authors of &lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids&lt;/i&gt; are Ken Ham, the founder of the young-earth creationist ministry Answers in Genesis, and Jessica DeFord, who, armed with a master of science degree in wildlife ecology, works for the same organization. In consequence, their book is a mix of error and fantasy, with the errors resembling those of secular climate change deniers and the fantasies emanating from their own reading of — and creative additions to — the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of the eighty-page book purports to address the evidence for climate change and for anthropogenic climate change from the historical record. It would be tedious to describe all of its errors, but a central misunderstanding deserves attention. Acknowledging that “[t]he observational data shows [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] that the global surface temperature of the earth has been warming over the past 100 years or so since it has been recorded” and reporting that the amount of warming is estimated to be about 1.5–1.8 °C, Ham and DeFord then caution, “But this warming estimate didn’t come solely from the observational data collected at weather stations and by satellites. It’s based on computer models. What you input into these models will decide what predications [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] the computer model provides” (p. 18). A footnote offers a 2022 paper by meteorologist Roy W. Spencer and climatologist John R. Christy, both at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, as evidence for the middle sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the problem? Well, the cited paper, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2162757/v1&quot;&gt;Dependence of Climate Sensitivity Estimates on Internal Climate Variability During 1880–2020 &lt;/a&gt;,” is prominently labeled “This is a preprint; it has not been peer reviewed by a journal.” So Ham and DeFord have no business citing it. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-023-04634-7&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of the paper was later published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Theoretical and Applied Climatology&lt;/i&gt;, although it seems not to have attracted significant scientific attention. More importantly, though, in neither version of their paper do Spencer and Christy claim that the warming estimate is based on computer models. And that is simply because the warming estimate is not based on predictive computer models! Rather, it is based on observational data, namely, measurements taken by surface and satellite thermometers. True, both data sets require adjustment and correction in light of factors that introduce biases. But their close agreement, unmentioned by Ham and DeFord, is strong confirmation that the climate is warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham and DeFord conclude, “So the predictions don’t necessarily reflect the real-world, observational data” (p. 18) — which is odd, since no predictions are under discussion. They add, “And one study that compared computer climate models to the observational data found every single climate model they studied overpredicted warming,” citing a 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2020EA001281&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Ross McKitrick, a professor of economics at the University of Guelph, and Christy. But the paper focuses on the ability of a certain class of models, not all models, to predict tropospheric, not surface, temperatures. (It is a robust scientific finding that we live on the surface of the planet.) A comprehensive analysis of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL085378&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; them to be “skillful in predicting subsequent GMST [global mean surface temperature] changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model-projected and observationally estimated forcings were taken into account.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrated here is Ham and DeFord’s general approach to handling the scientific literature on climate change: cite a single source that seems to offer evidence for the necessary point without worrying about whether it is legitimate, relevant, or confirmed by the bulk of scientific research. Sometimes, however, they abandon the approach in favor of bald assertion. Continuing, Ham and DeFord assert, with dubious coherence, “Climate researchers generally assume Earth maintains a constant average temperature and that our atmosphere traps more heat from the sun than what is returned to outer space” (p. 19), but they provide no examples of any researcher making such assumptions. Similarly, they claim that there is evidence that both of these “assumptions” are wrong, thus invalidating any models incorporating them, but they provide no references to such evidence. In any case, the views of climate scientists on these questions are not a matter of assumption but of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their view that there’s no telling how much Earth has warmed since the 1880s, Ham and DeFord are apparently willing to concede that recent global warming is real. But they misrepresent the argument for its anthropogenic nature, writing, “Since humans burn fossil fuels and burning fossil fuels produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; traps heat … we must be responsible for any warming … right?” (p. 20, ellipses in original). In fact, climate scientists have not jumped to their conclusion as &lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids&lt;/i&gt; suggests; rather, they have meticulously examined all of the known mechanisms capable of changing the climate and have concluded that greenhouse gases released by human activities are responsible for recent global warming. Popular explanations of the way in which they reached their conclusion are easy to find. For Ham and DeFord to misrepresent the argument so badly suggests at best that they are incompetent to write a book about climate science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paleoclimatology is dismissed on the grounds of a general skepticism about scientific knowledge of the past: “You can’t directly test, observe, or repeat the past!” (p. 33). “Scientists cannot 100% accurately describe past events if they were not there to directly observe them,” Ham and DeFord assert (p. 33), ignoring the fact that, far from claiming 100% accuracy, scientists typically report their findings with error bars. From a secular point of view, their emphasis on dismissing paleoclimatology is odd: until recently, paleoclimatological data (as well as historical data) were not considered to be as reliable as data from climate models, so the best evidence for the anthropogenic nature of climate change was from climate models — which are, of course, rooted in basic physics as applied to observational data. But Answers in Genesis, as a young-earth creationist ministry, is heavily invested in disputing the possibility of scientific knowledge of the past, and Ham and DeFord evidently want to put the investment to work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids&lt;/i&gt; insists, “God and His Word is the ultimate authority by which we must discern all climate and weather information” (p. 53), and Ham — who nominally takes over the narration from p. 54 onward — explains, “As I’ve read the Bible to understand ‘climate change’ events that affect us to this day, God has revealed 7 climate ages divided into the history in the Bible” (p. 58). There are seven of these ages, presumably to rhyme with the seven days of creation; Answers in Genesis similarly discerns &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/bible-history/seven-cs-of-history/&quot;&gt;seven eras of history&lt;/a&gt;: Creation, Corruption, Catastrophe, Confusion, Christ, Cross, and Consummation. The alliterative muse apparently having deserted him, and no explicit nomenclature to be found in the Bible, Ham calls the seven climate ages Perfect, Groaning (i.e., postlapsarian, the label referring to Romans 8:22: “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now” [ESV]), Flooding, Icy, Shifting, Fiery, and Heavenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the displays at Answers in Genesis’s attractions, the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, the discussion of the seven climate ages (sprawled from p. 60 to p. 77) presents a reading of the Bible that both confabulates details that aren’t visible in the text (starting with the seven climate ages themselves) and fails to acknowledge a diversity of opinion among Bible-believing Christians. (On the attractions, see, for example, Susan L. Trollinger and William Vance Trollinger Jr.’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/10885/righting-america-creation-museum&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Righting America at the Creation Museum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and James S. Bielo’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyupress.org/9781479843244/ark-encounter/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ark Encounter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; for organizations of evangelical Christians who accept climate change, see, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://yecaction.org/&quot;&gt;Young Evangelicals for Climate Action&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creationcare.org/&quot;&gt;Evangelical Environmental Network&lt;/a&gt;.) Puzzlingly, the Groaning climate age is described as “continuing to this day, because God has not yet made a new heavens and earth to restore perfection” (p. 65); what’s the point of distinguishing among seven climate ages if there’s going to be overlap among them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids&lt;/i&gt; is purportedly aimed at readers nine years and older, and there are features, beyond the color illustrations on every page, clearly aimed at a young audience, such as boxes headed “Let’s ask” and “Why then?” and “From God’s Word” (with highlighted and annotated verses from the Bible). Still, having a four-page introduction from a septuagenarian Australian complaining about the secularism infecting his college education in the early 1970s seems like not the best way to attract the intended readership. Similarly, a fourth-grader might gaze upon the admonition “When climate change panic is induced and alarms are sounded in the media or in the halls of academia, we must exercise discernment” (p. 11) with a degree of puzzlement. Many of the cited sources (with details crammed, in tiny text, on p. 80) would certainly be beyond the ability of a young audience even to comprehend, let alone assess for scientific credibility. (A number of those works are in fact not scientifically credible.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But probably none of its readers are going to exercise discernment while poring over the arguments of the book. A five-star review posted at its publisher’s website comments, “I have it sitting on our coffee table in the living room (strategically placed!) and the kids have all flipped through it and learned so much!” “Flipped through” rings true. Rather, &lt;i&gt;Climate Change for Kids&lt;/i&gt; is geared for a readership that expects Answers in Genesis to have answers — so to speak — to all questions of importance to the Bible-believing Christian and so is less concerned about the quality than about the existence of the answers. Owning a copy of the book, and thus manifesting solidarity with Answers in Genesis, is what matters. Unfortunately, the same attitude is likely to bolster continuing efforts to derail, delay, and degrade action on the very real disruptions caused by anthropogenic global warming that are already afflicting people, including Ken Ham’s base, around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since at least May, 2024, the Creation Museum and Ken Ham have been discussing a new display, meant to describe the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; being drowned in the Biblical Flood of Noah (see for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/&quot;&gt;https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/&quot;&gt;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/&lt;/a&gt;). This display finally opened in late October, 2024. Figure 1 is 
this ridiculous display from Ken Ham’s blog. Pictures of the display are available on several Answers in Genesis’ and Ken Ham’s social media pages. Long (2024) describes the artwork going into this new display. Although the artwork depicting the dinosaur itself is excellent, the display has absurd, inaccurate, misleading, and dishonest information on the depositional environment of the surrounding sediment and the taphonomy of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; and other Cretaceous vertebrate fossils of Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, both owned by the Young Earth Creationistministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), espouse that the fossil record is a result of Noah’s Flood which occurred in 2348 BC. All employees of AiG must sign off on a “Statement of Faith” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/&quot;&gt;https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/&lt;/a&gt;), that states in part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The great flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and catastrophic in its effects. At one stage during the flood, the waters covered the entire surface of the whole globe with no land surface being exposed anywhere—the flood of Noah is not to be understood as any form of local or regional flood. The Noachian flood was a significant geological event, and most fossiliferous sediments were deposited at that time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%207.19%E2%80%9320&quot;&gt;Genesis 7:19–20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Pet%203.5%E2%80%937&quot;&gt;2 Peter 3:5–7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/whats-the-best-proof-of-creation/&quot;&gt;evidence is always subject to interpretation&lt;/a&gt; by fallible people who do not possess all information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Num%2023.19&quot;&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Sam%2022.31&quot;&gt;2 Samuel 22:31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2018.30&quot;&gt;Psalm 18:30&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2046.9%E2%80%9310&quot;&gt;Isaiah 46:9–10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isaiah%2055.9&quot;&gt;55:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%203.4&quot;&gt;Romans 3:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Tim%203.16&quot;&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this ends any attempt at science by AiG employees and replaces geology, paleontology, and all other science and history with unchanging religious dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of their weird dogma, AiG has an unusual take on dinosaurs and other prehistoric life forms. Both the Ark and Creation Museum have problematic displays on dinosaurs. In dioramas, dinosaurs are depicted as living with people, among ancient buildings, in stalls on Noah’s Ark, and most amazingly, fighting with humans and giants in a pre-Flood arena of death (see Figure 3 below). The Creation Museum has a actual skeleton of the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/em&gt; on display that was donated by white nationalist and neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/&quot;&gt;https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/&lt;/a&gt;). This &lt;em&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/em&gt; skeleton is depicted as drowning in Noah’s Flood in 2348 BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers in Genesis original dinosaur modeler and country singer, the recently deceased Buddy Davis, even has a children’s song that cultishly is meant to repeat Ken Ham’s catchphrase dogma that the fossil record is “Billions of dead things, buried in rock layers, laid down by water, all over the earth.” Davis gets children to repeat this again and again to music, a very effective indoctrination technique. The song can be heard in part here &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/media/audio/audio-archives/billions-dead-things-sample/&quot;&gt;https://answersingenesis.org/media/audio/audio-archives/billions-dead-things-sample/&lt;/a&gt; (Davis, ND).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; display continues this stream of indoctrination and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protoceratops&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most studied dinosaurs in the history of vertebrate paleontology. The peer-reviewed scientific literature on this dinosaur, the depositional environment of the surrounding sediments, and aspects of the dinosaur’s taphonomy (the study of how organisms decay and are fossilized) is simply enormous and only a fraction can be cited in this simple blog post. Surprisingly, Wikipedia has an excellent page describing &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;‘s physical characteristics, discovery, paleoecology, and various aspects of the dinosaur’s biology, as well as citations of the primary sources. Good accounts of basic information about the dinosaur can also be found in Dodson (1996); Prothero (2019); and Fastovsky and Weishampel (2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceratopsian &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; was a fairly small ornithischian dinosaur with complete growth sequences from very small juvenile specimens to adults about 2.5 meters long being known. Maximum body weight was slightly above 100 kg. Adults were quadrupeds, but juveniles may have been capable of walking as bipeds. The skull 🪓has a fairly large frill, and the nose of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; has a horn-like structure that doesn’t stand out as much as in other Ceratopsid dinosaurs. The teeth indicate the animal was a vegetarian, shearing off vegetation with the aid of a very sharp beak (a characteristic of many ornithischians). &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; had relatively large eyes (even the sclerotic ring is known) and strong limbs, suggesting it was well-adapted to dim light, and capable of burrowing, although burrowing is not certain. The &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; from Mongolia are a single species &lt;em&gt;P. andrewsi&lt;/em&gt;, while another, slightly larger species &lt;em&gt;P. hellenikorhinus&lt;/em&gt; is known from similar deposits in China. There are likely to be other species of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;, and the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Bainoceratops&lt;/em&gt; may be a synonym or a very close relative. All members of the Family Protoceratopsidae are Late Cretaceous (Campanian) in age, which is approximately 75 to 71 million years old (Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; was discovered in 1923 by scientists working for the American Museum of Natural History’s Third Central Asiatic Expedition to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia (for historical accounts see: Andrews, 1926; Andrews &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1932; Colbert, 1968 and 2000; Gallenkamp, 2001; and Sullivan, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2012) and formally described by Granger and Gregory (1923). After WWII, the Soviets, and still later Polish researchers did geological and paleontological research in this part of the Gobi. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, Japanese, Canadian, American (once again mostly from the American Museum of Natural History), and scientists from many other nations studied the Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of the Gobi (Colbert, 1968, 2000; and Sullivan &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2012). Note that for all their posing as scientists, creationists haven’t actually contributed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to this scientific exploration and original research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cretaceous-of-mongolia&quot;&gt;Cretaceous of Mongolia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; specimens from Mongolia are found in the Late Cretaceous Djadochta (sometimes spelled Djadokata or Djadokhta) Formation. The Djadochta is primarily a reddish colored fine- to medium-grained well-sorted quartz sandstone. There are minor amounts of conglomerates, siltstones, and calcareous nodule layers to be found in the unit. Regionally, the Djadochta is approximately 90 m (~300 feet) thick. Many of the beds are cross-bedded, but some are massive and do not show apparent sedimentary structures. Good descriptions, including stratigraphic columns, of the unit, can be found in Dingus and Loope (2000); Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2008); Fastovsky &lt;em&gt;et a_l. (1997); Jerzykiewicz (1997 and 2000); Jerzykiewicz and Russell (1991); Jerzykiewicz _et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1993); Loope &lt;em&gt;et al. _(1998); Loope _et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1999); and Shuvalov (2000). Wikipedia also has a very general description of the unit and cites some of the primary literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new display at the Creation Museum is rather short on describing the Djadochta Formation. It literally cartoonishly contrasts the “Naturalistic Evolutionist” versus “Biblical Creationist” interpretation with actual cartoons depicting the burial of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;. The display simplistically claims “Naturalistic Evolutionists” think that &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; was buried by eolian (wind-driven) dunes during sandstorms, while they claim the dinosaurs were drowned and buried by underwater sandslides, driven by currents, during Noah’s Flood. The Creation Museum display only presents a tiny amount of selective evidence for their view, then declares victory over the “Naturalistic Evolutionists.” A September 29, 2024 “X” (formerly Twitter) post by Ken Ham includes a photo of part of the display. The main portion of the signage reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUNES OF DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;WATER OR WIND?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The circumstances surrounding the burial of fossilized animals at Ukhaa Tolgod in Mongolia help show the differences between observational and historical science and how worldviews shape one’s conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;THE SAME EVIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Creationists and evolutionists observe the same bones and agree that they are buried in ancient sand dunes, which can be formed by wind or flowing water. Proponents of either perspective can see that the dune cross-beds (remnants of sand avalanches) have 25° slope angles. All agree that the fossilization of the bones occurred when waterborne minerals seeped in and replaced the organic material. But while creationists and evolutionists use the same scientific evidence, they frequently interpret the evidence in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Both interpretations are based on the same evidence, but only one explains all the available data. Wind-formed dunes often have 28 - 34° downwind slope angles, whereas these slopes at Ukhaa Tolgod measure 25°- an angle more typical of water-formed dunes. Also, the sandstone encasing the animals is saturated with the waterborne mineral calcium carbonate. Ultimately, the evidence is more reasonably explained by biblical creation model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional text in the display includes a tear-jerking narrative about the poor &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; escaping by swimming in the early weeks of Noah’s Flood, only to face burial in a sand slide in “a water-formed dune.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual depositional environments of the Djadochta Formation are much more complex than the above creationist fantasy. While the Djadochta is considered to be primarily eolian sands, there is evidence of a complex facies mosaic that also includes alluvial fan deposition, fluvial deposits in the form of short-lived streams, as well as minor areas with lacustrine (lake) deposition (see: Dingus and Loope, 2000; Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2008; Jerzykiewicz, 1997 and 2000; Jerzykiewicz and Russell, 1991; Jerzykiewicz et al., 1993; Loope &lt;em&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt; 1998 and Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1999; and Novacek &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1994). Besides the well-sorted cross-bedded sandstone, other evidence for the rock being deposited in a semi-arid desert environment comes from the presence of caliche deposits that probably represent paleosols, and vertical traces that represent numerous invertebrate burrows. Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1998) illustrate the cross-bedding, carbonate nodules, and probable dinosaur tracks in the sandstone in their figure 3. Several examples of burrows and rhizoliths (fossil plant roots) are illustrated in Jerzykiewicz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1993).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the vertebrate fossil bearing layers lack any discernible sedimentary structures other than caliche layers that contain rhizoliths. These units are have been described as “structureless sands.” Dingus and Loope (2000) and Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2008) interpret these “structureless sands” as dune-derived sand-slides from times of lessened aridity/increased humidity (mesic conditions). Some of the evidence for times of increased humidity is described by Dingus and Loope (2008), who document crayfish-like burrows that represent unknown arthropods that dug down through the dry sands to reach groundwater. During these relatively-humid “mesic” times, dunes were held in place by caliche paleosols and vegetation, only to become oversteepened and eventually suddenly collapse, burying &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops, _other dinosaurs&lt;/em&gt;, _and other vertebrates of the Djadochta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of features characterize eolian deposits in the rock record, but no single criterion characterizes &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; eolian rocks. Eolian depositional environments can be incredibly complex and not easily characterized be cartoonish diagrams. The Creation Museum signage claiming the cross-bedding has the exact slope angle of 25° in the Djadokata Formation at Ukhaa Tolgod as being significant is simply not correct. In reality, ancient dune deposits can display very shallow to extremely steep cross-bedding angles. In many cases the angle is due to the moisture content and composition of the sand. For example, dry, well-sorted sand tends to pile up at maximum angles of 30 to 34° (Hill and Moshier, 2016), while slightly more moisture from various causes can result in angles above 40° (Bigarella, 1974). However, when sands become saturated with water, they can not maintain a steep slope and collapse. Hill and Moshier remind their readers that have built sandcastles at a beach of this property of moisture-rich sand. Moreover, very shallow slopes are also possible near the base of the downwind side of dunes (Bigarella, 1974). Thus, although eolian dunes tend to have steeper maximum cross-bedding compared to sand deposits formed under water, the exact angle alone doesn’t differentiate them from underwater sandbars. Ahlbrandt and Fryberger (1982) beautifully illustrate a number of eolian deposits and discuss additional criteria for the recognition of eolianites. These include the mineralogy, sorting, and tabular nature of the deposits themselves, combined with numerous sedimentary structures besides cross-bedding. In their detailed study of the Djadochta Formation, Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2008) also note many of the features discussed above, including calcareous paleosols, trace fossils in the form of dinosaur tracks, invertebrate burrows, and rhizoliths (fossil plant roots). Niedzwiedzki, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, (2012) note a track beneath a &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; skeleton. Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2008) also note that the Djadochta is a mosaic of several facies, including dune deposits, siltstone interdune deposits, conglomerates that had their source in outwash from alluvial fans, and sandslide deposits from dunes that occasionally collapsed after a period of stability. Interspersed with this were small lakes or ponds that accumulated silty muds and sands. Interestingly, the Creation Museum signage mentions the presence of the mineral calcite (CaCO₃) as if it were indicative of a marine deposit, whereas the mineral is also often associated with the caliches and paleosols that form in arid desert environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the source for the creationist misinformation on the Djadochta Formation? I have only been able to find two discussions in the creationist literature, both by AiG geologist, Dr. Andrew Snelling (1998 and 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Snelling (1998), he discusses unnamed creationists considering the possibility of the Djadochta Formation being post-Flood; as silly as this is, it would be a convenient way to accept the overwhelming evidence for eolian deposition. Snelling (2008) also represents Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1998) as somehow denying eolian deposits because of their proposal that the structureless sands were the result of sandslides that occurred suddenly during more humid (mesic) conditions. Snelling tries very hard to imply to his readers that since rainfall/water is involved, the rocks and fossils are somehow consistent with Flood geology. Putting the short review paper by Snelling side by side with the research by Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1998) just doesn’t jive. To be charitable, perhaps Dr. Snelling didn’t understand the conclusions of Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1998).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snelling (2009, pp. 547 - 549) appears to be the source of a lot of the misinformation on the Creation Museum’s signage associated with the &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; display. The signage and Snelling use almost identical language when discussing the cross-bedding slope angles. Lang (2024) discusses the artwork and signage of the new exhibit; one can conclude that the exhibit designer’s used Snelling (2009) as their major inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of ancient eolian deposits ends up having important economic benefits. Several eolian deposits in the Western United States and the North Sea produce oil and natural gas from porous and permeable eolian sediments. Additionally, groundwater is known to deposit of uranium and other economic minerals in eolian sedimentary rocks ( Ahlbrandt and Fryberger, 1982; Galloway and Hobday, 1983). Thus there are economic considerations in studying ancient eolian deposits, not just academic questions concerning earth history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taphonomy-of-protoceratops&quot;&gt;Taphonomy of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an enormous literature on the taphonomy (the study of the death and postmortem history of an organism to fossilization) of the &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; specimens from the Djadochta Formation. Fastovsky &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1997) is the major study, but much information can be gleaned from other sources. Protoceratops is commonly found completely or mostly articulated and are usually oriented parallel to the direction of crossbedding dip. Often the limbs are contracted and the necks pulled back (this death pose may be evidence for desiccation). However, Fastovsky &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1997) think that death often occurred via suffocation during sand storms. In contrast, the work of Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1998); Loope &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1999); Dingus and Loope (2000) and Dingus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2008) suggest sudden burial by the collapsing dunes as discussed above. Jerzykiewicz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1993, Figure 12) illustrate a complete &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; skeleton in a near-standing position, as if it died while struggling to escape the surrounding sediment. Hone &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2014) document several juvenile &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; that also represent death by burial in sand storms or dune collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most famous Djadochta Formation fossil is a specimen found by the Polish-Mongolian expedition of 1971. This amazing fossil is of a &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt; associated, perhaps during interspecific combat, with a &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;. This is illustrated in Jerzykiewicz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (1993, Figure 11). Barsbold (2016) defends the idea that these dinosaurs were rapidly buried in the act of the &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt; attacking the &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;. While scenarios where the fighting dinosaurs were buried during a dune collapse or sandstorm seem plausible, sudden burial of both animals together underwater does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-vertebrate-fossils&quot;&gt;Other Vertebrate Fossils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides _Protoceratops, _there are numerous other dinosaurs and terrestrial vertebrates to be found in the Djadochta Formation (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadochta_Formation&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadochta_Formation&lt;/a&gt; for a list). Especially important non-dinosaur fossils are the Mesozoic mammals discussed in Kieran-Jaworowska (2013) and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dinosaur-nests&quot;&gt;Dinosaur Nests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major discoveries of American Museum of Natural History’s Third Central Asiatic Expedition were the first recognized examples of dinosaur eggs and nests. These were first misinterpreted as being from the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;, although the bones of another dinosaur were often found with the nests. This other dinosaur received the name &lt;em&gt;Oviraptor&lt;/em&gt; (egg thief) because of the association, in the mistaken interpretation that it was stealing and eating &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; eggs. It was not until discoveries by scientists working for the American Museum of Natural History in the 1990s that it was determined that these are oviraptor eggs and nests (for popular accounts, see: Clark,1995; Mikhailov, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1994; Zelenitsky, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 2012); and a well-illustrated juvenile book by Norell and Dingus, 1999). Besides &lt;em&gt;Oviraptor&lt;/em&gt;, a more common oviraptoid named &lt;em&gt;Citipati&lt;/em&gt; is known from numerous Djadochta Formation specimens, including several that are fossilized brooding on their nests (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati&lt;/a&gt;)). These are scientifically documented in Norell &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1995; Clark, 1995; and Norell &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 2018. The most famous of these oviraptors of the genus &lt;em&gt;Citipai&lt;/em&gt; brooding on its nest is known as the “Big Mamma” specimen and is on display at the American Museum of Natural History (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati#/media/File:Citipati_AMNH.jpg&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati#/media/File:Citipati_AMNH.jpg&lt;/a&gt; for a copyright-free photograph). It is difficult to imagine how these oviraptors could have been building nests, laying eggs, then brooding over them in underwater sandslides, as the creationists are bizarrely suggesting. A terrestrial lifestyle and environment of deposition, whether burial in sandstorms or catastrophic collapse of eolian dunes, are reasonable explanations for these remarkable fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Fastovsky &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. described the first nest from the Djadochta Formation that is actually from &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;. This nest contains hatchlings of 15 juvenile &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops. _These juveniles are no more than 20 cm long and are all approximately facing the same direction. An oval-shaped margin to one portion of the fossil suggests that this is a portion of a round or oval-shaped nest. The baby _Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt;, although tiny, are larger than would be expected from ones that had immediately hatched. This size, along with the lack of egg shells in the nest, suggest they stayed with the nest and were benefited by at least some level of parental care after hatching. The orientation of the juveniles suggests alignment with a sandstorm. This fossil is not consistent with underwater deposition in an underwater sand dune. Answers in Genesis is aware of this fossil, Mitchell, (No Date, possibly 2011) cites this nest as being evidence for Noah’s Flood, but seems oblivious to the fossil’s actual implications against Flood geology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insect-borings&quot;&gt;Insect Borings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other taphonomic detail that is inconsistent with an underwater origin of Djadochta Formation dinosaur fossils is the presence of trace fossils consistent with large carrion-feeding insects found in and with the dinosaur skeletons. Kirkland and Bader (2010) and Saneyoshi &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2011) illustrate and discuss many examples of &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; skeletons, as well as other dinosaur fossils, that have circular holes and damaged areas near their joints. Moreover, there are traces of insect pupation chambers associated with these skeletons. These traces are certainly the result of a large carrion-feeding insect, perhaps similar to modern dermestid beetles, but possibly from another unknown group of beetles. Adult insects would have detected the decaying dinosaurs, burrowed into the unlithified sediment, then fed on the carcasses, eating into the bones and consuming cartilage and any available soft tissue. At some point the insects would have mated and laid eggs within the carcass so their future larvae would have a food source. After feeding and eventually growing to adulthood inside pupae, these larvae would have burrowed to the surface to repeat the process. Duff, 2024 discusses similar, albeit less spectacular, trace fossils associated with Cretaceous dinosaur bones from Mexico described by Serrano-Brana &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2018) at length as a “Flood geology failure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saneyoshi &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2011) also describe a single, larger (31 mm diameter), burrow in a &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; skeleton that could be interpreted as a small mammal feeding trace. None of these insect burrows and damage to the bones make sense in terms of the deposits forming underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussion-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Discussion and Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; display, and several other dinosaur-related displays already at the Creation Museum (see Phelps, 2007), perpetuate the odd creationist claims that their interpretation and conventional interpretations of geology and paleontology are the result of “worldviews.” AiG usually presents this as “God’s Word” versus “Human Reason.” Of course, “human reason” loses every time. This claim is part of what is known as “presuppositional apologetics” in Fundamentalist Christian circles. A typical example is this recent Tweet by Ken Ham (Ham, September 27, 2024) where he states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Did you know that creationists and evolutionists have the same facts? Christians and non-Christians have the same facts? The facts are not what people argue/debate over. It’s the interpretation of the facts that people argue about. And one’s worldview depends on the presuppositions they have. Ultimately, there are only two foundations our worldviews [sic.], God’s Word or man’s word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, and similar arguments for presuppositional apologetics, are often repeated in AiG’s vast output of materials, including this new &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; display. However, this is a rather shallow false equivalence by AiG. As this review of what paleontologists and geologists know about the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; and the rocks it was found in demonstrates, AiG only selectively looks at scientific evidence and often ignores a vast amount of contradictory evidence when comparing their Bible-based dogma to scientific evidence. AiG’s presuppositionalism requires that everything that contradicts their Biblical explanation is wrong and/or is to be ignored by definition (note AiG’s Statement of Faith, cited earlier). The resulting twists of logic from presuppositionsalism can be maddeningly insane. Consider this bizarre statement from 2007 on the AiG website (Answers in Genesis , 2007):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a person to make the claim that humans and dinosaurs did not coexist, they would have to be able to see all history at exactly the same time, which would make that person omniscient and omnipresent, qualities of God. So, when someone says emphatically that humans and dinosaurs did not exist together in the past, that person is claiming to be a god, while calling God Himself a liar, or, at best, deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AiG literature usually insist that theirs is &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; Biblical worldview, when even the majority of their fellow Christians disagree. And this insistence ignores a vast spectrum of other religious and philosophical views. In some of the photographs on social media of the new &lt;em&gt;Protoceratops&lt;/em&gt; display, they show another adjacent display that is labeled “Most Reliable Dating Method.” This display is of a Bible open to the Book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a YouTube video, Snelling (2022), in an interview with AiG’s Simon Turpin, gives his game away by stating their work is really about religious conversion rather than science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Andrew Snelling&lt;/strong&gt;: “…as I said to make sure that this is all freely is available to skeptics and you know arming all our people with the evidence. And of course there’ll be further articles in Answers Magazine, on our website, [and] live articles, because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;we want to be able to explain all this in more lay terms so that the average person can be armed with this information to go out and use it as a witnessing tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; because, after all, Simon, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you know it’s not about winning a scientific argument, you know, it’s about removing stumbling blocks that people raise to listening to the Gospel that people need to respond to. And you know we can argue about the scientific evidence until the cows come home, but the bottom line is you can convince people that there is a Flood, but unless you’re convinced that they need to respond to Jesus Christ as their Savior, they’ll go to Hell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Turpin&lt;/strong&gt;: “Amen Andrew, we’re going to end in a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emphasis added by DP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snelling comes clean by admitting that creationist “science” is all about religious conversion. Creationists reach their conclusions by ignoring large swaths of evidence that is contradictory to their dogma and sticking to predetermined conclusions, the evidence be damned. Actual science, in stark contrast, draws its interpretations from looking at multiple lines of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Protoceratops display, comparing &quot;evolutionist&quot; versus creationist explanations of fossilization. From Ken Ham’s blog. Fair use. &amp;nbsp; Since at least May, 2024, the Creation Museum and Ken Ham have been discussing a new display, meant to describe the dinosaur Protoceratops being drowned in the Biblical Flood of Noah (see for example https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/ and https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/). This display finally opened in late October, 2024. Figure 1 is this ridiculous display from Ken Ham’s blog. Pictures of the display are available on several Answers in Genesis’ and Ken Ham’s social media pages. Long (2024) describes the artwork going into this new display. Although the artwork depicting the dinosaur itself is excellent, the display has absurd, inaccurate, misleading, and dishonest information on the depositional environment of the surrounding sediment and the taphonomy of Protoceratops and other Cretaceous vertebrate fossils of Mongolia. The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, both owned by the Young Earth Creationistministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), espouse that the fossil record is a result of Noah’s Flood which occurred in 2348 BC. All employees of AiG must sign off on a “Statement of Faith” (https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/), that states in part: The great flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and catastrophic in its effects. At one stage during the flood, the waters covered the entire surface of the whole globe with no land surface being exposed anywhere—the flood of Noah is not to be understood as any form of local or regional flood. The Noachian flood was a significant geological event, and most fossiliferous sediments were deposited at that time (Genesis 7:19–20; 2 Peter 3:5–7). And further: No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information (Numbers 23:19; 2 Samuel 22:31; Psalm 18:30; Isaiah 46:9–10, 55:9; Romans 3:4; 2 Timothy 3:16). Of course this ends any attempt at science by AiG employees and replaces geology, paleontology, and all other science and history with unchanging religious dogma. Because of their weird dogma, AiG has an unusual take on dinosaurs and other prehistoric life forms. Both the Ark and Creation Museum have problematic displays on dinosaurs. In dioramas, dinosaurs are depicted as living with people, among ancient buildings, in stalls on Noah’s Ark, and most amazingly, fighting with humans and giants in a pre-Flood arena of death (see Figure 3 below). The Creation Museum has a actual skeleton of the dinosaur Allosaurus on display that was donated by white nationalist and neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka (see: https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/). This Allosaurus skeleton is depicted as drowning in Noah’s Flood in 2348 BC.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Steatoda triangulosa</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/10/steatoda-triangulosa.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Steatoda triangulosa" /><published>2024-10-28T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-28T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/10/steatoda-triangulosa</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/10/steatoda-triangulosa.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following is a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lie-Unraveling-Evolution-Millions-Years-ebook/dp/B0DD4YLQRQ/&quot;&gt;The Lie&lt;/a&gt;, by Ken Ham (Master Book, 2024), and a comparison of the 1987, 2012, and 2024 editions. A longer article appeared &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2024/10/reviewed-ken-hams-the-lie-unravelling-the-myth-of-evolution-millions-of-years-and-why-we-need-to-pay-attention.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in 3 Quarks Daily.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first remind you of the scale of Ken Ham’s political significance. He has among his friends Mike Johnson, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, whose law firm has represented AiG pro bono. And among the contributors to its magazine is Calvin Beisner, director of the Cornwall Alliance, whose entire purpose is to deny the importance of human-caused climate change. Cornwall in turn has direct links to the Heartland Institute and to the Heritage Foundation, authors of Project 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers here will be familiar with the destructive and anti-scientific approach of the modern creationist movement in the US. But that’s only half the story. It is not only about the beginning of the world, but about its ending. Genesis is pivotal, but so is Revelation. So are the many hints of the end of the world that are explicit in the New Testament, and can be discovered with sufficient ingenuity in the Old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such thinking underlines the apocalyptic tone, repeatedly echoed in AiG’s material, that underlies current US right-wing politics. If the Earth does not have a deep past, we cannot expect it to have a prolonged future. We should not be concerning ourselves with conservation, but with righteousness. This perspective has political implications, and comparing the 1987 and 2024 versions of &lt;i&gt;The Lie&lt;/i&gt; shows the political aspect becoming increasingly explicit. Otherwise, there is not much difference between the two editions, though The third edition is more repetitious and, where direct comparison is possible, less vigorous in its use of language, and more hectoring, than the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade before &lt;i&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/i&gt;, Henry Morris had written a much shorter book, &lt;i&gt;The Bible and Modern Science&lt;/i&gt;, whose final chapter is devoted to claims that biblical prophecies are being fulfilled in our own times, and are signs of Christ’s imminent return. Prominent among these is the return of Jews to their ancestral homeland. Similar thinking explains why US fundamentalist evangelicals are now among Israel’s most unquestioning supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently reviewed at length the 1987 (1st ed.) and 2024 (3rd ed.) versions of &lt;i&gt;The Lie&lt;/i&gt;, and the differences between them. Here I will use material from that review to comment on some of the most extraordinary aspects of the work, draw attention to the narrowness of Ham’s portrayal of Christianity, and discuss the changes between the two editions. 

Ham himself  tells us that it was &lt;i&gt;The Lie&lt;/i&gt; that positioned Answers in Genesis as a biblical authority ministry. That’s not true. When it was published in 1987, Ham was still an employee of Morris’ Institute for Creation Research, while his own organization was not incorporated until 1993, amid much unseemly and litigious infighting, and its title, Answers in Genesis, only dates from 1994.
  
Ham’s approach is unsubtle, uncompromising, and unburdened with excess erudition. It is also completely devoid of originality, since all the ideas he expresses are already there in the writings of Henry Morris and his precursors. The book describes itself as concerned with “the foundational nature of the book of Genesis to all Christian doctrine.” By “the book of Genesis,” Ham means a plain literal meaning, with a 6-day 24-hour creation, ignoring two millennia of exegesis and two centuries of literary and archaeological scholarship, and reducing the beautiful, complex, many-layered text to a cardboard cutout.

The title of the first chapter tells us that “Christianity is Under Attack,” or, in the third edition, “Under Massive Attack.” Modern society has moved away from Christ, but the book promises to outline “a Biblical (and therefore successful)” approach.

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Braterman_Lie_Seven Cs_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seven C's of Ken Ham&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Seven C's of Ken Ham. &lt;small&gt;3rd ed., p. 58, fair use.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 

The third edition takes the opportunity to claim victimhood for Christianity, and to attack an unspecified secular wokeness, signaling the book’s political tendency. It then shows the attached figure listing what it regards as our contemporary ills, all caused by a falling away from Ham’s version of Christianity.

This is an extraordinary list. Something very strange is happening when those who call themselves followers of Christ object to the idea of social justice. Of the 16 items on this list, seven (CRT, Inclusion, Identity Politics, Social Justice, Mandates, Intersectionality, and Woke) express political views, with some of which one might have expected a follower of Jesus to sympathise, and none bear any relationship to the book’s ostensive agenda.

It gets worse. The third edition at this point questions the concept of separation of church and state, asserts that the public education system is not neutral, since it teaches naturalistic explanations, quotes Matthew 12:30 that one is either for Christ or against him, and says that

&lt;blockquote&gt;To help parents understand the reality of the situation, I suggest we say “anti-God schools” instead of public (secular) schools to remind us of what these institutions really are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the public school system teaches naturalistic explanation, says Ham, it is indoctrinating into a religion of atheism, thus undermining Christianity and Christian morality

Here we have the reason for creationist advocacy of voucher schemes, designed to use public funds for children to be educated at creationist schools, and for homeschooling. The upsurge in political support for voucher schemes, which incidentally starves the public sector of funds, is now a major problem; see, e.g., here.

The discussion of sexual behavior, especially homosexuality, is a fine example of Ham’s reasoning: We know that homosexuality is wrong because homosexuality is condemned in numerous Bible verses. But without the Bible, we would not have convincing reason for calling it wrong, although it clearly is. Thus homosexuality is wrong because the Bible says so, and the Bible’s condemnation of homosexuality confirms that biblical morality is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham uses the familiar creationist argument that the study of the past, as in evolution science, is not science at all. For science involves repeatable observations, and the past is unrepeatable. He boasts of how he used this argument, in his school-teaching days, to undermine his colleagues’ teaching. It is also very attractive argument, since those who accept it believe that they have been granted a superior insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, The third edition tells us that
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Creation Museum, we summarize biblical history as the Seven C’s of History — Creation, Corruption, Catastrophe, Confusion, Christ, Cross, and Consummation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Susan and William Trollinger point out in their book about the Museum, these 7 C’s are strongly reminiscent of the 7 D’s of dispensationalism, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premillennialism&quot;&gt;premillennialist&lt;/a&gt; interpretation of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham appears completely oblivious of the fact that his own interpretation of Genesis is heavily laden with assumptions. Or if he is, he no doubt attributes them to the operation within him of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham argues that Christians who accept the findings of secular science are being inconsistent. If they choose to accept millions of years, they have succumbed to the disease of naturalism, of which evolutionism is merely a symptom. And naturalism is itself a religion, since by denying God’s role it is a form of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this in the book’s first chapter. The remaining 150 pages add little new, and I will content myself with a few significant points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3, “Creationism is Religion,” tells us that the Creation took place in six days, and God called it “very good.” It follows that there was no death, all animals were vegetarians, the climate was mild from pole to pole, and there was no bad weather. However, this Edenic state of affairs did not last. Why not?
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because our first parents placed human opinion above God’s word (as we continue to do), struggle and death entered the world and God cursed the creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wickedness of later generations brought on Flood, and the billions of fossils laid down the Flood sediments (all sediments, we take it, are Flood sediments) remind us of “God’s judgment on sin.” Nonetheless, after the Flood the earth once again became filled with corruption because of human sin. Christ’s death and resurrection conquered death, and through Him we may be born into eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus as surely as God created the world and judged the world with the Flood, our ungodly world will be destroyed by fire. For those who trust in Jesus, however, there awaits eternal life in the new heavens and new earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note again the linking of the judgement of the Flood to the coming judgement of fire. This theme is developed further in the concluding chapter, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third edition covers the same ground in greater detail, once again invoking the 7 C’s, and presenting Ham’s creative reinterpretations of specific verses as if they were God-given.&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the core of Christianity, as represented by Answers in Genesis, and the movement of which it is part. It is a curious form of Christianity, reducing it almost to a commercial transaction. What you have to do, is trust in Jesus. And He in return will give you eternal life, after this world has been destroyed. Nothing here about love your enemies, turn the other cheek, blessed are the peacemakers, who is my neighbor, I was hungry and you fed me not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer scan of the third edition shows 180 references to sin, and just 35 references to love, of which only 8 refer to love between human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4, “The Root of the Problem,” accuses evolution of providing justification for rebellion against God. Moreover, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the evolutionists have to do is to come up with one piece of evidence that conclusively proves evolution &lt;/i&gt;[emphasis in original]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across this kind of assertion all the time in social media. It is difficult to know how to deal with an argument so confidently presented while being totally at variance with reality (right now, the problem also arises in areas other than evolution). The evidence for the historical fact of evolution was conclusive, by all reasonable standards, over a century ago. Moreover, the time interval between the 1987 and 2024 editions of the book have produced further layers of evidence, based on DNA relationships. The creationist organizations themselves are well aware of these developments. However, as I mentioned earlier, Ham has set up his rules of evidence in advance, in such a way as to be free to ignore them. We see here the rhetorical device of &lt;i&gt;demanding the impossible&lt;/i&gt;. Ham is asking for proof, but has already stated that the relevant evidence is unacceptable. He then uses the absence of proof that he would regard as acceptable, as conclusive evidence that his opponents are arguing in bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 gives a few other examples of what Ham claims, to my mind completely falsely, to be biblical teaching. For example, Genesis gives us the doctrine of marriage as the union between one man and one woman for life. I am reduced to wondering whether Ham has actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; Genesis. For if he did, what he would find there is arranged marriage to preserve the bloodline, fathers selling their daughters, concubinage, polygamy, women procuring their slavegirls as breeding stock for their husbands, and levirate marriage, whose purpose is to provide a dead man with an heir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also says that the Bible tells us that from the point of conception (in the 2024 edition, of course, this becomes the point of fertilization), we are human beings, so that abortion in all instances is killing a human being. Yet the Bible chapters that he himself cites (Psalm 139, Jeremiah 1) speak of the child &lt;i&gt;being formed&lt;/i&gt; in the womb; the very opposite of what he tells us. He objects to women pastors, because (no verse cited) God created men and women for separate roles. There are also vague references, again with no verse cited, to the process of appointing deacons, and strict discipline (I think he means spanking) for children. Ham’s version of biblical Christianity is shot through with such nonbiblical opinions, in all their lamentable fallibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 6, a great deal is said of the need for clothes, in order to curb sexual arousal, and about humanity’s inherently sinful nature. As further evidence of the growing politicization of AiG, the third edition goes out of its way at this point to mention President Obama’s and President Biden’s support for gay marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7 tells us that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are received back to God to spend eternity with Him. Isn’t that a wonderful message? &lt;i&gt;That is the message of Christianity&lt;/i&gt; [emphasis in original].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course, as I mentioned earlier, other aspects to Christianity, such as loving your neighbor, but the book seems strangely unaware of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 tells us of The Evils of Evolution, which as we have seen include lawlessness, homosexuality, and abortion. 
&lt;p&gt;The third edition now goes out of its way to mention Planned Parenthood, which it describes as “one of the biggest child-killing ‘machines’ in the world,” and mentions in linked paragraphs that its founder, Margaret Sanger, was a fervent eugenicist, and that she promoted the use of birth control. As we have seen, the changes between the first edition and The third edition tells us very plainly how AiG is developing politically, and we must take the reference to birth control very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, with no sense of irony, Ham tells us in successive paragraphs that evolutionary thinking has been used to defend male chauvinism, and that Christian women should not be deceived by the feminist movement, which is anti-God, since God has given men and women different roles. The third edition even warns us of the danger that “women will abuse their role and want to usurp the authority of the man in regard to headship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then summarizes his arguments to date by a cartoon showing two opposing castles. The castle of Christianity is wasting its ammunition by firing at specific targets, while evolution, guided by Satan, attacks the Christian doctrine of creation. Such at least is what we see in the 1987 version of the cartoon, which has been discussed here before. It is one of many such drawings scattered throughout the book, which do have a certain faux naïve charm. The 2024 version, by contrast, looks so bad that I wonder whether it is AI-generated. But notice the reference in the later version to Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Chapter 10, Wake Up, Shepherds! repeats the message that the only sound preaching is based on one particular interpretation of Genesis. Both editions go out of their way to attack and belittle Darwin, as is usual, but the third edition adds a remark so outrageous, that I cannot forbear from comment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the time of Darwin, much research has shown that observational science (e.g., the study of genetics) does not confirm Darwin’s ideas but actually contradicts them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ham taught biology, and environmental biology was his degree major. He graduated in the early 1970's, and it is difficult to believe that he was unaware of the way in which the coming together of Mendelian genetics, classical paleontology, and the solving of the genetic code were placing evolution science on an ever-firmer foundation.

Chapter 11, Creation, Flood, and Coming Fire, concludes the book’s central argument by linking the creation of this world to its imminent destruction. It starts with a quotation also used by Henry Morris in his 1951 book, &lt;i&gt;The Bible and Modern Science&lt;/i&gt;, and again in &lt;i&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/i&gt;. Ham devotes particular attention to this passage, and so should we:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a prophecy in II Peter concerning the last days of this earth’s history, and it very much relates to the whole creation/evolution issue:
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
  
II Peter 3:3-7 (NIV) states: “First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers welcome, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, ‘Where is this coming He promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.’ But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s Word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water with water. By water also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.”
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

We see this prophecy being fulfilled in front of our own eyes. The people who tell us that “everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation” are the evolutionists and deep time geologists. They use the principle that “the present is key to the past,” and invoke the observed present-day processes of sedimentation and mutation in their discussions of geology and evolution.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In this, they are “willingly ignorant.” They have deliberately chosen not to believe in the Genesis account of creation, God’s judgement of the world at the time of Noah’s Flood, and coming judgment by fire. If they do not think that the geological record is convincing evidence of the Flood, that is because they do not want to be convinced. And the reason why they do not want to be convinced is that they do not wish to acknowledge God’s authority, obey His rules, and stand in awe of the coming judgment by fire. The very fact that the Biblical account is being questioned is itself a fulfilment of Biblical prophecy, confirming (as if confirmation were required) that the Bible account is true.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The sun, moon, and stars are evidence of God’s creation. The sediments are evidence of God’s judgment in the Flood, and Last Day’s prophecies are being fulfilled before our eyes. And, just in case we haven’t got the point, a final quotation in bold from II Peter 3:11-12a:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming &lt;/i&gt;[emphasis in original].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How we are supposed to speed its coming, it may be wiser not to inquire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Footnote:
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

1. Ham repeatedly imposes his theologically motivated interpretation on the text. For those interested in exegesis, I pedantically present a couple of examples from the third edition, where we are given, in successive paragraphs without explanation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The very first time the gospel is preached is in Genesis 3:15:
  
&lt;i&gt;And I will put enmity between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel &lt;/i&gt;[emphasis in original].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The set up of the sacrificial system and a picture of what was to come in Jesus’ sacrifice on the Cross is found in Genesis 3:21:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them &lt;/i&gt;[emphasis in original].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ham is imposing, and is expecting his readers to impose, meanings imported from commentaries. In verse 3:15, the serpent has been equated with Satan, the woman’s seed with Jesus, the bruising of the heel refers to Jesus’s suffering in His human aspect, and the bruising of the head is Jesus’ triumph over Satan. The capital H’s correspond to nothing in the Hebrew text, but are inserted because Ham thinks the pronouns refer to Christ. In 3:21, tunics of skin imply that an animal has been killed for the purpose, and for reasons I do not quite understand this is a foreshadowing of the Crucifixion.

If you regard all this as contorted and arbitrary, I quite agree. Or you may regard it as serious exegesis, some at least of which goes back to the Church Fathers. But whatever your opinion, the point is that this is material added to the text, not found within it, and therefore, by Ham’s own criteria, part of man’s thoughts, here misrepresented as God’s.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this spider inside the house the other day and managed to get a picture showing the 8 eyes. In case you were wondering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F&quot;&gt; what it is like to be a bat&lt;/a&gt;, think about what it must be like to be a spider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiders have simple eyes, as opposed to compound eyes like those of a dragonfly. Because the eyes are so small, they cannot have good resolution: Even if the eyes were diffraction-limited, their sensors would have to be roughly the same size as the cones in human eyes, for example, and there would be many fewer of them. (In photographic terms, all diffraction-limited F/4 lenses have the same resolution limit, but a longer focal-length lens affords more detail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phys.ufl.edu/courses/phy3221/spring10/HaldaneRightSize.pdf&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; by Haldane notes that an eye is not very good until it reaches a certain size, but a colleague of mine has just pointed out that context matters and the spider does not need a better eye.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Wikipedia entry on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_vision&quot;&gt;spider vision &lt;/a&gt;, the two central eyes in the lower bank are the &lt;i&gt;principal eyes&lt;/i&gt;, and they do their best to form an image, but the pixels (if you will) are nowhere near the focal point. The spider is thus dreadfully nearsighted, though he must get some imaging due to the depth of field. The other, &lt;i&gt;secondary&lt;/i&gt; eyes are used for light and motion detection, and, for example, polarization detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a little late out of the starting blocks, but last Sunday Francis Collins published an opinion article titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/opinion/covid-vaccines-truth-life-death.html&quot;&gt;Take It From a Scientist. Facts Matter, and They Don’t Care How You Feel&lt;/a&gt; in the opinion section of The New York Times. In case there are any readers who do not know it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins&quot;&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt; is the former director of the Human Genome Project and more recently director of the National Institutes of Health. He presided over NIH in the early part of the pandemic and during the development of vaccines for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article, he outlines the development of the vaccines and rightly bemoans the number of Americans who refused to get vaccinated, even when vaccination was free. He notes that white evangelical Christians, of whom he is one, were the most highly resistant to getting vaccinated. He says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public distrust, driven by social media, cable news and even some politicians, reflected a host of concerns: whether Covid-19 was real, whether it was really all that serious, whether the vaccines were rushed, whether there were common and serious side effects that had been hidden, whether the mRNA would alter the recipient’s DNA and whether companies had skirted the rules about safety. More outlandish conspiracies also circulated on social media: that the vaccines contained microchips or cells from recently aborted fetuses, for example. People of faith were particularly hard hit by misinformation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Collins avers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are in serious trouble when some believe that their faith requires them to distrust science or when others believe that political allegiances are a better source of wisdom than truth, faith or science.… In many aspects of our daily lives, the anchor to objective truth seems to have been lost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing not only his coreligionists, Dr. Collins asks rhetorically, “&lt;strong&gt;What do we mean&lt;/strong&gt; by truth anyway? [Emphasis in original].” He asks us to imagine a set of concentric circles, sort of like a target, I guess. The central area, the bull’s-eye, encompasses what he calls “necessary truth,” such as 2 + 2 = 4, or A = πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The next circle out (a ring or annulus, in reality) subsumes conclusions that are so overwhelmingly supported by theory and experiment that they truly ought to be considered facts: the inverse-square law of gravity and the facts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;DNA is the hereditary material for humans. The average temperature of planet Earth is rapidly increasing — yes, it really is. And Covid vaccines were tested in rigorous trials in 2020 and found to be safe and effective. These statements are all established scientific facts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next ring out includes claims that may be true, “but the evidence is currently insufficient to move them into the circle of firmly established facts.” For example, did mask mandates reduce Covid transmission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, opinions, such as “Dogs make better pets than cats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Collins stresses the importance of knowing which annular area pertains: Are you sure that everything you consider factual is well-established? Are you sure that claims you consider mere opinion are not facts? Equally, he argues that we must have serious conversations with people with whom we disagree. I was reminded of a recent comment by a pen-pal of mine, who decried calling Mr. Trump’s, um, prevarications about the election “lies.” He would prefer, and I agree, calling them “unsubstantiated claims,” so as not to immediately antagonize listeners who may be sympathetic to Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to the article, much of it, I thought, bordering on pabulum of the “we need to build consensus” variety. I sincerely hope, though, that Dr. Collins can convince some of his fellow evangelicals to accept facts and adjust some of their opinions accordingly, rather than succumb to mis- or disinformation, such as rumors about the Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Collins says, “The consequences of vaccine misinformation have been utterly tragic.” You can say the same about misinformation about climate change, which he mentions but does not discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">President Biden bumps fists with NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins during a visit to the NIH campus on December 2, 2021.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glenn Branch is deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit organization that defends the integrity of American science education against ideological interference. He is the author of numerous articles on evolution education and climate education, and obstacles to them, in such publications as &lt;/i&gt;Scientific American, American Educator, The American Biology Teacher&lt;i&gt;, and the &lt;/i&gt;Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics&lt;i&gt;, and the co-editor, with Eugenie C. Scott, of &lt;/i&gt;Not in Our Classrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools&lt;i&gt; (2006). He received the Evolution Education Award for 2020 from the National Association of Biology Teachers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1925, a young teacher, John T. Scopes, was on trial in Dayton, Tennessee, for violating a recently enacted state law, the Butler Act, which forbade educators in the state&amp;rsquo;s public schools to &amp;ldquo;teach any theory that denies the truth of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&amp;rdquo; The Scopes trial was instantly a national sensation, partly thanks to the participation of two national figures &amp;mdash; William Jennings Bryan on the prosecution team and Clarence Darrow on the defense team &amp;mdash; and the reportage of a third, the brilliant but mordant journalist H. L. Mencken. With its hundredth anniversary just around the corner, the Scopes trial is understandably attracting attention again, with recent treatments including Randy Moore&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomsbury.com/in/scopes-monkey-trial-9798216184171/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Scopes &amp;ldquo;Monkey Trial&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2022), Gregg Jarrett&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Trial-of-the-Century/Gregg-Jarrett/9781982198572&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trial of the Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2023), and Brenda Wineapple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/648098/keeping-the-faith-by-brenda-wineapple/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeping the Faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2024). These are all more or less readable and accurate guides to the context, personalities, conduct, aftermath, and significance of the trial. And then, in contrast, there is Jerry Bergman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wipfandstock.com/9798385200887/the-other-side-of-the-scopes-monkey-trial/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the thesis of &lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial&lt;/em&gt;? According to its subtitle, &lt;em&gt;At Its Heart the Trial was about Racism,&lt;/em&gt; while within the text, Bergman awkwardly declaims, &amp;ldquo;The trial was about human evolution, and more about &lt;em&gt;racism and eugenics&lt;/em&gt; than religion and evolution&amp;rdquo; (p. 5, emphasis in original). Later, a section complaining that commentators on the trial ignore the racism and eugenics of both classroom textbooks and the American scientific community of the 1920s is entitled &amp;ldquo;Denying the Core of the Scopes Trial&amp;rdquo;; in the following chapter, Bergman writes, &amp;ldquo;That the teaching of eugenics was at issue in the Scopes Trial was obvious to those who understood what eugenics is all about is clear&amp;rdquo; (p. 61); and the chapter after that is entitled &amp;ldquo;The Scopes Trial: A Struggle Against Eugenics and Racism.&amp;rdquo; And in the final chapter, Bergman concludes, &amp;ldquo;The racism and eugenics that was central in the Scopes Trial has been ignored, even though it is a well-documented part of the record&amp;rdquo; (p. 195). Thus, although there is a certain perplexing vacillation between racism and eugenics, the book&amp;rsquo;s thesis appears to be that the Scopes trial was about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a glaring obstacle to the thesis, which in fact Bergman briefly acknowledges: that &amp;ldquo;in the entire Scopes court &lt;a href=&quot;https://profjoecain.net/scopes-monkey-trial-1925-complete-trial-transcripts/&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; the topic of eugenics and racism was avoided&amp;rdquo; (p. 81, link added). He then clutches at a counterfactual straw, suggesting that if Bryan, a prominent Democrat, had been a Republican, then he might have focused &amp;ldquo;on the racism and eugenics core of the Hunter textbook [&lt;em&gt;A Civic Biology&lt;/em&gt;, from which Scopes taught]&amp;rdquo; (p. 81). But as matters stand, the Scopes trial was clearly not about racism and eugenics. It is equally clear that a number of the participants in and observers of the Scopes trial held various attitudes toward racism and eugenics, which were matters of public controversy in the 1920s &amp;mdash; but there would be no point in writing a book to document the fact. Is there a thesis in the neighborhood that is neither clearly false nor clearly trivial? Perhaps that the attitudes toward racism and eugenics of the participants in and the observers of the trial significantly and substantially influenced the conduct of and the public understanding of the trial? That suggestion threads the needle, but it would require meticulously collected and judiciously assessed evidence to make the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No attempt to make such a case is visible in &lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial&lt;/em&gt;, and meticulous collection and judicious assessment of evidence are likewise absent. Instead, there is hagiographizing, conspiracy theorizing, and mudslinging. For example, amid Bergman&amp;rsquo;s fulsome praise for Bryan, there is no mention of what his biographer Michael Kazin described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/90625/a-godly-hero-by-michael-kazin/9780307424358/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Godly Hero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2006) as &amp;ldquo;Bryan&amp;rsquo;s habit of ignoring the &amp;lsquo;race problem&amp;rsquo; or minimizing it with fatuous rationales,&amp;rdquo; which culminated with his last political &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/183009/craziest-convention-american-history&quot;&gt;success&lt;/a&gt;: convincing the 1924 Democratic National Convention not to adopt a party platform plank condemning the Ku Klux Klan by name. Bergman alleges that the leaders of the American Civil Liberties Union, which coordinated Scopes&amp;rsquo;s defense, &amp;ldquo;no doubt openly, or covertly, agreed to ignore the most important part of the Scopes case, namely its racism&amp;rdquo; (p. 74), a claim for which there is no rationale evident except for the need to protect his thesis come what may. Chapter 10, the longest chapter of the book, is a sustained attempt at assassinating the moral character of Mencken &amp;mdash; who, to be sure, was not exactly a paragon on matters of race, gender, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even independently of the fact that it consists entirely of a string of decontextualized quotations from Mencken&amp;rsquo;s voluminous oeuvre with Bergman&amp;rsquo;s perfunctory and sometimes bizarre comments on them, intended to portray Mencken as,&lt;em&gt; inter alia&lt;/em&gt;, a vicious racist, eugenicist, and bigot, chapter 10 is deeply problematic. The problem is that Bergman&amp;rsquo;s discussion is conspicuously similar to Vincent Torley&amp;rsquo;s 2012 blog post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.angelfire.com/linux/vjtorley/mencken.html&quot;&gt;H. L. Mencken: Is this your hero, New Atheists?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; not only in the selection and order of the quotations but also in the language used to summarize and criticize them. For example, Torley asks, with respect to a whimsical suggestion of Mencken&amp;rsquo;s that God should have used platinum rather than carbon as a basis for life, &amp;ldquo;But has Mencken even thought for a moment about how a platinum organism would eat, excrete, reproduce and for that matter, evolve?&amp;rdquo; while Bergman declares, &amp;ldquo;Mencken had obviously not thought about how platinum-based organisms could possibly eat, grow, excrete and, for that matter, evolve&amp;rdquo; (p. 161). Bergman cites Torley&amp;rsquo;s blog post only once (p. 128, n. 15), regrettably not in a way that adequately acknowledges his apparent debt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bergman&amp;rsquo;s scholarly practices are otherwise troubling. He often cites subpar scholarship, including from his fellow creationists, without any evident discernment. He repeatedly interpolates unwarranted text of his own into verbatim quotations, including in a passage from Martin Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s history of the twentieth century (p. 9), a letter from Leonard Darwin &amp;mdash; a son of Charles Darwin, writing on behalf of the Eugenics Education Society &amp;mdash; to Scopes (p. 61), and a passage from Edward J. Larson&amp;rsquo;s book about the trial (p. 195). Similarly, he claims that &amp;ldquo;a survey of AAAS members found that close to 99 percent are functional atheists, meaning that they live their lives as if there is no God&amp;rdquo;: he is evidently referring to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2015/07/23/an-elaboration-of-aaas-scientists-views/&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey in 2014 that found that close to 99 percent of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science accept that humans have evolved over time: the &amp;ldquo;functional atheism&amp;rdquo; claim is a confabulation. He wrongly claims that the pistol-packing pastor J. Frank Norris came to Dayton, Tennessee, during the Scopes trial, citing &amp;ldquo;Larson, &amp;lsquo;Classroom Controversy,&amp;rsquo; 54&amp;rdquo;: the article in question begins on p. 63 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/9326/pandas-black-box&quot;&gt;The Panda&amp;rsquo;s Black Box&lt;/a&gt; (2007) and Norris is not mentioned in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly interesting error is not entirely Bergman&amp;rsquo;s fault. Relying on James Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s account in &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo3615369.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redeeming Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1997), he claims that Bryan argued to the West Virginia legislature in 1923 that evolution is precluded by the second law of thermodynamics. (He then proceeds to endorse the argument, unaware or uncaring that it is scientifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12052-009-0195-3&quot;&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt;.) That would be strange if true, not only because Bryan fails to use the argument in his most famous antievolution writings, such as &lt;em&gt;In His Image &lt;/em&gt;(1922) and his planned closing address in the Scopes trial, but also because the argument seems to have gained currency only with the work of two British creationists, Robert E. D. Clark and E. H. Betts, in the 1940s. (The wrinkle that the second law is the objective correlative of the Fall would later be introduced in &lt;em&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/em&gt; [1961], by John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris.) But it is not true. And it would not have been difficult for Bergman to locate Bryan&amp;rsquo;s speech, reprinted as the second part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/OrthodoxChristianityVersusModernism&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orthodox Christanity versus Modernism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1923), and there to find that the closest Bryan approaches the second law of thermodynamics is invoking the distinct phenomenon of radioactive decay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bergman repeatedly, and correctly, emphasizes that the Butler Act, under which Scopes was prosecuted, only concerned the teaching of human evolution. He accordingly devotes chapter 9 to a discussion of human evolution. The result is inaccurate and incompetent. He claims that the scientific evidence for human evolution presented at the Scopes trial consisted of &amp;ldquo;Nebraska Man, Piltdown Man, Java Man, and Neanderthal Man fossils&amp;rdquo; (p. 106), and devotes most of the chapter to &amp;ldquo;Nebraska Man,&amp;rdquo; repeating whole sentences and paragraphs in the process. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.atavist.com/curious-case-of-nebraska-man-william-jennings-bryan-scopes-trial-evolution-creationism/&quot;&gt;Nebraska Man&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; was known only from what proved to be a fossil peccary tooth &amp;mdash; not, pace Bergman, a fossil pig tooth &amp;mdash; and was not presented at the Scopes trial, although it might have been if Henry Fairfield Osborn, the president of the American Museum of Natural History and the chief promoter of the fossil, had testified. Perhaps exhausted by his Nebraskan efforts, Bergman dismisses &amp;ldquo;Java Man&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;another race of humans called &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (p. 118) &amp;mdash; not exactly a devastating rejoinder &amp;mdash; and fails to rehearse the standard, long-ago-refuted, creationist complaints about &amp;ldquo;Piltdown Man&amp;rdquo; (a never tremendously convincing hoax) and Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of Bergman&amp;rsquo;s myriad errors are tendentious. Stephen Jay Gould is misquoted as referring to the &amp;ldquo;populace&amp;rdquo; rather than the &amp;ldquo;populist&amp;rdquo; thinking of Bryan (p. 26); the anthropologist Ruth Benedict is rechristened Ruth Bennet (p. 37); the polling organization Gallup departs at a gallop (p. 55). Bergman reports that &amp;ldquo;the Supreme Court refused to hear the Scopes appeal&amp;rdquo; (p. 103): if he&amp;rsquo;s thinking of the Tennessee Supreme Court, he&amp;rsquo;s wrong because the court indeed heard the appeal, overturning the verdict, while if he&amp;rsquo;s thinking of the United States Supreme Court, he&amp;rsquo;s wrong because the case was not appealed to it. Two paragraphs of chapter 12, which contains only six paragraphs, rely on the conclusions of &amp;ldquo;Georgianna,&amp;rdquo; with no full name or bibliographical information provided. (&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proquest.com/openview/c8cd810026d7c7700ecda2d5ae839f8d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;amp;cbl=18750&amp;amp;diss=y&quot;&gt;The Moral Majority and Fundamentalism: Plausibility and Dissonance&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; Sharon Linzey Georgianna&amp;rsquo;s 1984 dissertation at Indiana University, was presumably intended.) The sole appendix presents the text of a Tennessee law: not the Butler Act, but House Bill 368/Senate Bill 893 of 2012, nicknamed &amp;ldquo;the monkey bill&amp;rdquo; and codified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2021/title-49/chapter-6/part-10/section-49-6-1030/&quot;&gt;Tennessee Code 49-6-1030&lt;/a&gt;. No explanation is offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in &lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial&lt;/em&gt;, Bergman writes, &amp;ldquo;The present work is an attempt to fill in this important gap&amp;rdquo; (p. 7). Characteristically, there is no explicit description of a gap in the preceding text, but he appears to mean that there&amp;rsquo;s a lack of discussions of the trial sympathetic to the prosecution, which overlooks any number of works, including Marvin Olasky and John Perry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/em&gt; (2005), which appears in Bergman&amp;rsquo;s bibliography. A shoddy and biased apologia for creationism, &lt;em&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/em&gt; is nevertheless head and shoulders over &lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial&lt;/em&gt;: not nearly so badly conceived, researched, organized, written, and edited. After offering his description of &amp;ldquo;the present work,&amp;rdquo; Bergman continues, &amp;ldquo;and it is up to readers to determine how successful this tome was&amp;rdquo; (p. 7) &amp;mdash; for all the world as if readers are unaware of their prerogatives. Only readers who are already relatively familiar with the trial are guaranteed to recognize the abject failure of the book, unfortunately; despite the crudity and incompetence of what can only be described as Bergman&amp;rsquo;s propaganda, there is a risk that the uninformed and the gullible will be misled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Glenn Branch</name></author><summary type="html">William Jennings Bryan (left, seated) being questioned by Clarence Darrow at the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee.

Ever!, published on September 10, 2024, by Righting America, a forum for scholarly conversation about Christianity, culture, and politics in the US. Glenn Branch is deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit organization that defends the integrity of American science education against ideological interference. He is the author of numerous articles on evolution education and climate education, and obstacles to them, in such publications as Scientific American, American Educator, The American Biology Teacher, and the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, and the co-editor, with Eugenie C. Scott, of Not in Our Classrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools (2006). He received the Evolution Education Award for 2020 from the National Association of Biology Teachers. In the summer of 1925, a young teacher, John T. Scopes, was on trial in Dayton, Tennessee, for violating a recently enacted state law, the Butler Act, which forbade educators in the state&amp;rsquo;s public schools to &amp;ldquo;teach any theory that denies the truth of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&amp;rdquo; The Scopes trial was instantly a national sensation, partly thanks to the participation of two national figures &amp;mdash; William Jennings Bryan on the prosecution team and Clarence Darrow on the defense team &amp;mdash; and the reportage of a third, the brilliant but mordant journalist H. L. Mencken. With its hundredth anniversary just around the corner, the Scopes trial is understandably attracting attention again, with recent treatments including Randy Moore&amp;rsquo;s The Scopes &amp;ldquo;Monkey Trial&amp;rdquo; (2022), Gregg Jarrett&amp;rsquo;s The Trial of the Century (2023), and Brenda Wineapple&amp;rsquo;s Keeping the Faith (2024). These are all more or less readable and accurate guides to the context, personalities, conduct, aftermath, and significance of the trial. And then, in contrast, there is Jerry Bergman&amp;rsquo;s The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial (2023). What is the thesis of The Other Side of the Scopes Monkey Trial? According to its subtitle, At Its Heart the Trial was about Racism, while within the text, Bergman awkwardly declaims, &amp;ldquo;The trial was about human evolution, and more about racism and eugenics than religion and evolution&amp;rdquo; (p. 5, emphasis in original). Later, a section complaining that commentators on the trial ignore the racism and eugenics of both classroom textbooks and the American scientific community of the 1920s is entitled &amp;ldquo;Denying the Core of the Scopes Trial&amp;rdquo;; in the following chapter, Bergman writes, &amp;ldquo;That the teaching of eugenics was at issue in the Scopes Trial was obvious to those who understood what eugenics is all about is clear&amp;rdquo; (p. 61); and the chapter after that is entitled &amp;ldquo;The Scopes Trial: A Struggle Against Eugenics and Racism.&amp;rdquo; And in the final chapter, Bergman concludes, &amp;ldquo;The racism and eugenics that was central in the Scopes Trial has been ignored, even though it is a well-documented part of the record&amp;rdquo; (p. 195). Thus, although there is a certain perplexing vacillation between racism and eugenics, the book&amp;rsquo;s thesis appears to be that the Scopes trial was about these issues.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Partial lunar eclipse</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/09/partial-lunar-eclipse.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Partial lunar eclipse" /><published>2024-09-18T09:26:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-09-18T09:26:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/09/partial-lunar-eclipse</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/09/partial-lunar-eclipse.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;
