&lt;p&gt;I am writing in response to the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.12775/SetF.2024.010&quot;&gt;Bridging ideological divides: Why Christians still disagree about evolution and what we whould do about it&lt;/a&gt;, by Hans Madueme and Todd Charles Wood, &lt;i&gt;Scientia et Fides&lt;/i&gt; 12(1), 2024, 189–213; open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcz.umk.pl/SetF/article/view/45459/38251&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is written by two young earth creationists, who take 25 closely argued pages including 93 references to show complete misunderstanding of the relationship between observation and interpretation in evolution science, in order to claim a false epistemic symmetry between this science and the theological perspective which forces them to reject it; a more sophisticated version of the “two pairs of spectacles” thesis that has been with us since George McCready Price. So why am I bothering to review this article? And why, to my own surprise, do I find myself welcoming its appearance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three reasons. Firstly, because the authors, unlike “creation science” young earth creationists, accept the validity of the science in its own terms, rather than claiming that it is inferior to their own fantastical offerings. Secondly, because they lay out extremely clearly (and self-revealingly) their own epistemic position. And finally, because their recommendations, made regarding conversations within the evangelical community, are applicable (and indeed to some extent already applied) to the very practical problem of how to teach evolution science in places with a faith-based culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd Wood is a name that will be familiar to many readers here. He has a PhD from University of Virginia, conducted postdoctoral work for two years at Clemson, and has published five papers in leading journals on different aspects of molecular phylogeny. He is now applying his skills to baraminology, the attempt to explain the multiplicity of present species in terms of descent from the limited number that could have fitted onto Noah’s Ark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a joke. He describes his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Pattern-Life-Origins-Organization/dp/0805427147&quot;&gt;Understanding the Pattern of Life: Origins and Organization of the Species&lt;/a&gt;, in the preface, as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;an expression of my attempt, however feeble, to allow the truth of God to transform my view of biology. Rather than trying to prove the truth of Scripture, I use it as a starting point. From there, I build what I believe to be a reasonable model of biology that fits both the facts of Scripture and the data of creation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://henrycenter.tiu.edu/contributor/hans-madueme/&quot;&gt;Hans Madueme&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at Covenant College Georgia, appears to be highly regarded in his field, and has edited a volume, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/reading-christian-theology-in-the-protestant-tradition-9780567266149/&quot;&gt;Reading Christian Theology in the Protestant Tradition&lt;/a&gt;, published by Bloomsbury. Despite (or perhaps because of) his own convictions, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2019/06/creationism-embattled-yet-resilient-a-redirect/&quot;&gt;been highly critical&lt;/a&gt; of claims made on behalf of creation science..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authors are adamant in their own beliefs, they are opposed to polemics, and for this reason, as we shall see, single out for praise Jason Rosenhouse’s Among the Creationists (reviewed in PT &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/07/among-the-creat.html&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of their argument lies in the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific theory of evolution involves higher-level models that are associated with a range of non-scientific factors, including exegetical and theological judgments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something seems (and indeed is) back to front here. Some scientists work for the greater glory of God, and some to put God out of business, while I expect that most have never given a thought to theological issues. Their conclusions may have implications in “exegetical and theological judgments,” but these are consequences, not components, of the scientific framework. Why do Wood and Madueme (W&amp;amp;M) think otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors spell out their position, early on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e argue that the scientific theory of evolution involves higher-level models that are shaped by non-scientific factors. We then show that theological commitments—held not only by Christians but by non-theists as well—affect those higher-level models that influence our epistemic assessment of evolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So non-theists ln their attitude to evolution science are influenced in ways that presumably they do not realize by theological commitments. As a non-theist and former theist who has always accepted mainstream evolution science on its merits, I consider this claim both unwarranted and presumptuous, and disconcertingly close to the claim made by many creationists that evolution is itself a form of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, gradually, we find out what is behind the claim, and why it is crucial to the authors’ entire outlook. They admit the range and strength of the scientific evidence for common ancestry, which is the aspect of evolution science most directly relevant to their own theological concerns, and quote the appraisal by the philosophers McCain and Weslake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence for common ancestry includes the fossil record, comparative anatomy, embryology, genetics, and geographic species distribution, while natural selection gains support from natural and laboratory work, including computer simulations and mathematical models.&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gijsbert van den Brink and his colleagues distinguish three different layers of evolutionary theory, namely, 1) historical evolution, 2) common descent, and 3) natural selection.2 They conclude that multiple, mutually reinforcing lines of evidence for historical evolution render it strongly beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence for common descent, they argue, is also strong though less than the evidence for historical evolution (“weaky beyond reasonable doubt”). They give the lowest evidential score to natural selection, given notable scientific disagreements about its importance in evolution (van den Brink et al. 2017, 466–68).&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt; Most scientists would agree with these conclusions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think would most readers here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, could W&amp;amp;M maintain their own rejection of evolution? Easily! They have prepared the ground by saying (p. 198), in response to this classification,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Common ancestry acts as a higher-level model that coordinates and supports more directly empirical models (like natural selection) within or beneath it.&lt;/i&gt; [Emphasis in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyword here is “supports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Common ancestry does not support the data. It is an outcome, not an input, much as process uniformitarianism is an outcome from looking at ancient rocks. Or, to take an example with which I do not think W&amp;amp;M could possibly disagree, atomic theory is the higher-level model used by chemists since long before they could observe the effects of individual atoms. However, this status is not an overarching presupposition, but the outcome of diverse observations, ranging from the combining ratios of elements to the properties of gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors give another example of why they regard common ancestry as a higher-level model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that common ancestry was accepted during the eclipse of Darwinism indicates that scientists could accept this higher-level model independently of any details of how common ancestry came to be.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary. Common ancestry continued to be accepted, even though (in W&amp;amp;M’s version of history) Darwin’s causal mechanism had been rejected, because of the way in which it was supported by the many lines of evidence that they themselves had listed. Bottom-up, not top-down. John Paul II &lt;a href=&quot;https://humanorigins.si.edu/sites/default/files/MESSAGE%20TO%20THE%20PONTIFICAL%20ACADEMY%20OF%20SCIENCES%20(Pope%20John%20Paul%20II).pdf&quot;&gt;got it right&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is indeed remarkable that this theory [evolution] has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If W&amp;amp;M do not see things this way, it is because they are committed to top-down reasoning. As they say, in a section titled “Evolution without theological presuppositions is impossible,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dogmatic commitments inevitably shape our overall judgments of the epistemic status of evolution. Theology is the epistemic linchpin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They impose such dogmatic commitments even when they are absent.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Thus they cite Richard Dawkins’s famous remark, “Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist,” as evidence that our theology shapes our views on evolution, when Dawkin himself tells us that it was the other way round; learning about evolution led him to reject his former faith. This inverted perspective makes it possible for them to say in all seriousness,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some epistemic judgments depend on how one evaluates the clarity of nature against the clarity of Scripture. Young-earth creationists tend to foreground the perspicuity of Scripture and the fallibility of science, while theistic evolutionists tend to emphasize the clarity of science and the ambiguity of exegesis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My translation: Young earth creationists think that their own exegesis of Scripture and commitment to its truth gives them the right to overlook both the scientific evidence and the possibility that their exegesis itself may be in error. This on the basis of a false equivalence between the two epistemic evaluations: on the one side, a priori commitment to a doctrinal position, and on the other, willingness to pay attention to facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later they elaborate on this very point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We agree with scientific realists that the objective data in creation should inform any assessment of evolution, but the process of interpreting the data should also entail theological oh judgments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the authors are claiming the right to interpret facts to fit their theological preconceptions. If they do not like the outcome of a scientific enquiry, they will demand that the evidence be tortured until it says what they want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, something interesting happens, that changes the reader’s perspective on everything that has gone before. Having established that for Christians like them, the epistemic status of evolution will depend on theological considerations, they then admit that Christians can reasonably disagree about this theology. Understandably, they deplore the way in which unbelievers and evolution-accepting believers alike regard young earth creationism as absurd. More surprisingly, they deplore the mirror-image attitude of young earth creationists such as Henry Morris and John MacArthur, who describe those who accept evolution as atheistic, irrational, and amoral. They invoke the great commandment to love one another, too often neglected as “we evangelicals find group identity and security in our confessions, doctrinal statements, and ideological consortiums,” and for this reason urge dialogue even when such dialogue seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors, I now belatedly realize, are not really talking to me but to those who share their own fundamental outlook. If they have been at great pains to affirm their own epistemic position, that is partly to establish their own credentials, and partly to suggest to their fellows that respectful treatment of a different epistemic position may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are practical reasons for the dialogue that they are commending. Evolution-accepting Christians should not be made to feel unwelcome in churches where they are in the minority. Conversely, creationism-accepting students should not be ignored or silenced in the science classroom. Here they cite the philosopher and former biology teacher Douglas Allchin, who discusses how to engage such students, and advocates examining epistemology, building trust, and considering evolution in the context of the moral order.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; As practical examples of the mutually respectful attitude that they recommend, they quote at some length from Jason Rosenhouse’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Among-Creationists-Dispatches-Anti-Evolutionist-Front/dp/0199744637&quot;&gt;Among the Creationists&lt;/a&gt; (reviewed on PT &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/07/among-the-creat.html&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;), with his emphasis on the enriching experience of seeing those we disagree with as real people, not merely defined by stereotypes and the oddity of their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this also reminded me of James Krupa, award-winning biology professor at the University of Kentucky, who concludes his lectures with explicit discussion of social resistance to evolution.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Even more relevant is the approach being developed by Constance Bertka and colleagues.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Here, as a prelude to the discussion of evolution, students consider the range of possible views on the relationship between religion and science, from conflict to integration. Comparing hermeneutics, just as W&amp;amp;M are advocating. A strange alliance, between those dedicated to the effective teaching of evolution science, and those who fundamentally oppose its conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as different as possible from the attitude that runs through the mainstream creationist literature, from George McCready Price onwards, and that is expressed in the blurb&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to Wood’s own book, &lt;i&gt; Understanding the Pattern of Life&lt;/i&gt;, I mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Darwinian evolutionary theory has been largely recognized over the last century to be the most pervasive and damaging influence on modern society. As a frontal assault on the Kingdom, evolution has been Christianity's most notorious detractor and its greatest foe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed? The times have changed. As W&amp;amp;M put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the North American context, the polarized and fractured political climate illustrates how sinful division can fester in the absence of ideological interaction. Sober reflection on the consequences of ideological segregation should motivate us to cultivate the true discipline of dialogue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed. And we do not need more riots on the steps of the Capitol, or more pastors forced out of their congregations for showing independence of thought, or more memoirs like Tim Alberta’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Power-Glory-Evangelicals-Extremism/dp/006322688X &quot;&gt;The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory&lt;/a&gt;, to show us what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zachary Hancock is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan and specializes in evolutionary genetics.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution by natural selection requires that there exists variation in fitness between individuals. This simple truism goes back to Darwin’s Origin of Species, but where Darwin relied on verbal arguments, the statistician and population geneticist R.A. Fisher sought to codify this basic fact mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1930, Fisher published The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, and within introduced the fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS). The FTNS is, in effect, a restatement of Darwin’s idea on the reliance of natural selection on variation. In words, the FTNS states that the rate of change in a population’s average fitness is equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness at that time. An implication of this is that when there’s a ton of variation in fitness, the population’s average fitness can increase rapidly by natural selection. But if there is very little differences in fitness among individuals, any subsequent fitness increase must be slow or absent entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind the FTNS is quite simple, even if the derivation mathematically has caused many biologists to scratch their heads over the many decades since Fisher first introduced it. Some, like Warren Ewens (Ewens 1989), have argued that Fisher’s theorem is useless, while others, such as George Price (Price 1972), Alan Grafen (Grafen 2003), and Sean Rice (Rice 2004) have contended it is, indeed, a general theorem properly understood. Point here is that the FTNS has been a source of much debate for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, two creationists wandered into this rather esoteric historic dispute. And as is characteristic of creationists, they did so without a clear appreciation of the field they were embarking to critique and with highly suspect motivations. Bill Basener—a mathematician and data scientist at the University of Virginia—and John Sanford—retired Cornell plant geneticist, inventor of the gene gun, and promoter of “genetic entropy”—together (and “BS” hereafter) published a paper in the Journal of Mathematical Biology titled “The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had two goals. First, they wanted to hype the FTNS—they claim that it offered “mathematical proof of Darwinian evolution,” providing what they believed was the much sought after mechanism for perpetual fitness increase. Remember, to BS the definition of fitness is something like “net information” or “net functionality” (Basener et al. 2021). That is, a bacterium is simpler than a catfish, and thus has lower fitness. So, to them, the FTNS was an attempt to show how a bacteria-like organism can “progress” into something fancier and more complex (“from goo to the zoo to you,” as the saying goes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they wanted to show that actually the FTNS is incomplete because it doesn’t consider where new mutations come from, and what their effect on fitness might be. And now we’ve moved from the enigmatic FTNS to, for readers of Panda’s Thumb, the much more familiar territory of genetic entropy. That’s right: BS add their own distribution of fitness effects (DFE) to the FTNS—one highly skewed towards deleterious alleles with a fraction of beneficial mutations of only 0.001—and then, using numerical simulations, show that fitness is expected to decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The punchline of BS is that the FTNS, while touted as a mathematical proof of Darwinian evolution, was actually derived under questionable assumptions (e.g., no dominance or epistasis) and when “corrected,” actually predicts fitness should decrease. Creationist news agencies had a field day with headlines such as “A Mathematical Proof of Darwinian Evolution Is Falsified” and “Flipping Fisher’s Famous Theorem.” Rob Carter of CMI published a YouTube video titled “Fisher’s failure and the dramatic end of Neo-Darwinism.” Juicy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many defenders of evolutionary biology have responded—including &lt;a href=&quot;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/does-basener-and-sanfords-model-of-mutation-versus-selection-show-that-deleterious-mutations-are-unstoppable/&quot;&gt;Joe Felsenstein and Mike Lynch&lt;/a&gt;—these responses were either in blogs or in video format and tended to focus on the “genetic entropy” part of BS and argue that the FTNS was not foundational in any sense, given that &lt;a href=&quot;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/does-all-of-evolutionary-theory-rest-on-fishers-fundamental-theorem/&quot;&gt; most of the mathematics of natural selection&lt;/a&gt; had been derived in the preceding decades. Ultimately, the status of the FTNS is immaterial to the “creation-evolution debate.” Fisher could’ve been dead wrong in his derivations and evolution—as understood by biologists—would still be true, and natural selection would still rely on variation in fitness to work. Overturning Fisher’s theorem does nothing to challenge Darwin’s original argument. Genetic entropy, on the other hand, is a critique with more substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as both a population geneticist and a student of history, sympathetic to the view of Sean Rice and Alan Grafen of the generality of the FTNS, I couldn’t let BS slide. And BS (2018) is the closest Sanford has come to publishing his “genetic entropy” model in the peer-reviewed literature, so it seemed that we could kill two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Stern Cardinale of Rutgers and I decided to pen a response to BS, which has been published in JMB titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-024-02077-w&quot;&gt;Back to the fundamentals: a reply to Basener and Sanford 2018&lt;/a&gt; (the title serves as a play on Fisher’s fundamental theorem and the obvious fact that BS have severely misread The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, which many consider to be next in line in the great books on evolution to only Darwin’s own magnum opus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we had to clarify the assumptions of the FTNS. While BS contend it’s severely limited in its generality and assumes no dominance, epistasis, environmental effects, etc., we show that none of these are prerequisites for deriving the FTNS. To demonstrate this, we start from the famous Price Equation, which some have called the fundamental theorem of evolution (Queller 2017). We start here because the Price Equation is derived with no simplifying assumptions—it is a true general theorem. In words, it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[rate of change of the average of some trait] = [covariance between that trait and fitness] + [difference between parent-offspring trait average]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while fitness can be defined in many ways, in Price’s equation it is simply the number of offspring a parent leaves. Second, a covariance can be thought of as the shared change between two variables; for example, if longer fur is beneficial in a cold environment, then there will be a positive covariance between fur length (the trait) and how many offspring you leave (fitness). In this way, the Price Equation captures natural selection in the covariance term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FTNS is easily derived from this equation by simply letting “trait” be “fitness,” since parental fitness is expected to covary with offspring fitness—that is, fitness is heritable. Rewriting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[rate of change of average population fitness] = [covariance between parent and offspring fitness] + [difference between parent-offspring trait average]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how this looks much like the definition of the FTNS stated earlier. The “covariance” term can be clarified if we remember a simple mathematical identity. Some might be familiar with the concept of linear regression; this is when you fit a straight line through a plot of points such that the line minimizes the distance between all the points. It turns out, the covariance between two terms (like parent and offspring fitness) is equal to the slope of that line multiplied by the variance in parent fitness. Again, variance here is simply the mean of the squares of the spread of values around the average—high variance means there is high variation around the average value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since linear regression is a straight line, we call the variance that they capture the additive genetic variance. This means that irrespective of the genetic architecture of a trait, selection acts to shift the mean of that trait as if it were simply additive. Consider the simple plot in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2024/Hancock_Fig_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Figure 2. Demonstration of the “additive genetic variance.&quot; Here, W is parental fitness and Wo is offspring fitness. The rate that natural selection can shift the mean population fitness in each of these plots, despite the difference in genetic architecture, is equal to the slope of the red line (which is equivalent in both plots).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the slope of these is exactly the same, despite the trait clearly not being an additive trait in the second plot. Here, an “additive trait” means one in which every genetic locus contributing to the trait value does so as a simple sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that we are not performing a linear regression in the statistical sense of fitting a line to some data. Instead, we are relying entirely on mathematical identities: the definition of a covariance is [slope of a straight line as determined by least squares] × [variance of the independent variable].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By replacing the covariance term with this “additive genetic variance” term, we arrive at the classic way of viewing the FTNS: the rate of change in mean population fitness is equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness at that time. No simplifying assumptions were introduced. Fisher’s theorem is, it turns out, a general theorem, contrary to BS. Further, we see that the FTNS does not rely on there being no dominance or epistasis–it’s simply that natural selection acts on the additive variance irrespective of these. As James Crow once remarked, “Nature discovered least squares long before Gauss” (Crow 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we deal with BS’s claim that Fisher thought fitness would perpetually increase and that he viewed the distribution of mutational effects as symmetrical, equal parts beneficial and equal parts deleterious. It’s easy to debunk these ideas with Fisher’s own words. In The Genetical Theory, Fisher writes: “Against the rate of progress in fitness must be set off, if the organism is, properly speaking, highly adapted to its place in nature, deterioration due to undirected changes either in the organism, or in its environment. The former, typified by the pathological mutations observed by geneticists… The latter, due to… changes in the organic environment, including improvement of enemies and competitors… may be in effect either greater or less than the improvement due to Natural Selection” (Fisher 1930). So clearly, Fisher thought that there were other forces in nature that could counterbalance natural selection, and hence the FTNS couldn’t be a “mathematical proof” of perpetual fitness increase. It only serves to illustrate that natural selection, as a single component, acts to increase fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then introduce Fisher’s geometric model of adaptation to counter BS’s claim that Fisher thought the effects of mutations were symmetrical. To understand Fisher’s model, imagine a landscape of phenotypes that have valleys of low and peaks of high fitness. Moving across this phenotypic landscape is akin to changing the mean phenotype of the population. If you are far from a fitness peak, then taking a big step through the landscape (that is, a mutation of large effect on the phenotype occurs) is equally likely to move you in the right direction as in the wrong. But if you’re on a peak, large effect mutations almost always take you off the peak. Hence, the effects of mutations are context dependent, and the context is how well adapted the population already is to the environment they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite a different picture than how BS present Fisher’s views, and indeed how creationists often view the distribution of fitness effects (DFE). While they tend to present it as some fixed distribution, evolutionary biologists have never seen it that way; the effect of any mutation is dependent on the context in which it arose, both with respect to the environment but also with respect to the optimality of the trait in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, BS fumble Fisher’s views on mutations and fitness increase, and make false claims as to the assumptions necessary to derive the FTNS. The last thing we deal with is their claim that the FTNS, when it incorporates real mutational distributions, predicts fitness decline, not increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with Sanford’s “genetic entropy” model will already know where this is going. BS rely on a DFE from Kimura (1979) which was used to model effective neutrality and has no beneficial mutations; they add a tiny fraction—0.001—to that distribution and call it “real.” And, as stated above, they find fitness declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since BS (2018) has been touted as a peer-reviewed paper supporting genetic entropy, we decided to perform our own simulations as a direct response with the (naïve) hope that it puts genetic entropy out to pasture once and for all. We pull distributions from several empirical studies, modelling the deleterious fraction as gamma-distributed and the beneficial as exponential, with 99% of all mutations strictly deleterious. Of the beneficial fraction, the mean effect is only 0.001, and so most merely act to compensate for the loss of fitness from the deleterious. Fitness is absolute in our simulations, so as the population accumulates deleterious mutations, it can slowly go extinct. We run our simulations for 50,000 generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In opposition to BS, not only did our populations not go extinct, but actually grew in size (Figure 3). While the vast majority of mutations were deleterious (and many fixed!), the overwhelming preponderance of mutations that fixed were beneficial due to positive selection. This is because the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations always exceeds that of deleterious, even if they are approximately equal as |s| = 1/(2N), where s is the selection coefficient and N is the population size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists often tout studies showing that the vast majority of mutations are deleterious as evidence of genetic entropy. But as many have argued in the past and as our simulations show, this is neither an impediment to evolution nor a hinderance on adaptation. Fitness can still increase despite deleterious mutation pressure because of natural selection. Indeed, this brings us back to the FTNS: since there are differences in the fitness of individuals, and those differences are heritable, natural selection can act to increase the population’s mean fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

The different colors represent different replications of the calculation.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, BS misrepresent Fisher’s theorem by claiming it needs to be expanded to include mutations to introduce genetic entropy into a peer-reviewed journal. We argue in the last section of the paper that the “real target” of their assault on the FTNS was actually universal common descent. We expose this by simply letting their other publications speak for themselves, citing numerous examples in which they misrepresent both “fitness” and “Darwinian evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this reply to BS serves to undermine the credibility of the original paper. And, in the end, clarify an important and often debated concept in evolutionary biology—the fundamental theorem of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;

Evolution by natural selection requires that there exists variation in fitness between individuals. This simple truism goes back to Darwin’s Origin of Species, but where Darwin relied on verbal arguments, the statistician and population geneticist R.A. Fisher sought to codify this basic fact mathematically. In 1930, Fisher published The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, and within introduced the fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS). The FTNS is, in effect, a restatement of Darwin’s idea on the reliance of natural selection on variation. In words, the FTNS states that the rate of change in a population’s average fitness is equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness at that time. An implication of this is that when there’s a ton of variation in fitness, the population’s average fitness can increase rapidly by natural selection. But if there is very little differences in fitness among individuals, any subsequent fitness increase must be slow or absent entirely. The basic idea behind the FTNS is quite simple, even if the derivation mathematically has caused many biologists to scratch their heads over the many decades since Fisher first introduced it. Some, like Warren Ewens (Ewens 1989), have argued that Fisher’s theorem is useless, while others, such as George Price (Price 1972), Alan Grafen (Grafen 2003), and Sean Rice (Rice 2004) have contended it is, indeed, a general theorem properly understood. Point here is that the FTNS has been a source of much debate for decades. In 2018, two creationists wandered into this rather esoteric historic dispute. And as is characteristic of creationists, they did so without a clear appreciation of the field they were embarking to critique and with highly suspect motivations. Bill Basener—a mathematician and data scientist at the University of Virginia—and John Sanford—retired Cornell plant geneticist, inventor of the gene gun, and promoter of “genetic entropy”—together (and “BS” hereafter) published a paper in the Journal of Mathematical Biology titled “The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intelligent Design for Dummies, Part 1</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/04/intelligent-design-dummies.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intelligent Design for Dummies, Part 1" /><published>2024-04-18T09:09:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-04-18T09:09:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/04/intelligent-design-dummies</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/04/intelligent-design-dummies.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Jay Gould’s discussion of the panda’s thumb in his essay of the same name, originally published in 1978, is often misrepresented as describing the false thumb of &lt;i&gt;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&lt;/i&gt; as ineffective in practice rather than as inelegant in origin. A recent incidence of such misrepresentation prompted Glenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education to provide his discussion of a similar misrepresentation in a 2000 cartoon presentation of intelligent design, originally published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metanexus.net/&quot;&gt;Metanexus: The Online Forum on Religion and Science&lt;/a&gt; website in two parts on August 15 and 16, 2002. The following appears here in conformity with Metanexus’s republication policy and with Branch’s permission. Minor changes, primarily regarding punctuation, have been made invisibly, and a few updates have been included in square brackets. This is part 1 of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent design, according to Michael Behe,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;must be ranked as one of the greatest achievements in the history of science. The discovery rivals those of Newton and Einstein, Lavoisier and Schrodinger, Pasteur, and Darwin. The observation of the intelligent design of life is as momentous as the observation that the earth goes around the sun or that disease is caused by bacteria or that radiation is emitted by quanta (Behe 1996: 232–233). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a great scientific achievement, of course, deserves a careful exposition in a suitably scholarly format. But instead what it received is &lt;i&gt;What’s Darwin Got to Do With It&lt;/i&gt;? (henceforth, for brevity, WDGDWI), Robert C. Newman and John L. Wiester’s cartoon treatment of intelligent design (Newman and Wiester 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WDGDWI is clearly a product of the notorious Wedge strategy for promoting intelligent design creationism, devised by Phillip Johnson (who lauds the book as “deadly accurate — and more fun than a barrel of Australopithecines”) and implemented by the Discovery Institute’s Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture [now &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/evolving-banners-discovery-institute&quot;&gt;Center for Science and Culture&lt;/a&gt;] (Forrest 2002). WDGDWI’s dedication thanks the DI’s CRSC for “its technical, critical and financial support” (page iv), and both Janet and Jonathan Moneymaker, who collaborated with Newman and Wiester on the book, are [as of 2002] Fellows of the CRSC. (According to Newman’s posting on Amazon.com’s page for WDGDWI [no longer available], the cartoons are mainly Janet Moneymaker’s, the story line is mainly due to Newman and Jonathan Moneymaker, and the bulk of the task of providing “the science input” was Wiester’s.) Access Research Network, a “research partner” of the CRSC, is currently [as of 2002] promoting WDGDWI as part of its Teachers’ Origin Resource Kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, neither Newman nor Wiester is directly associated with the DI’s CRSC. Newman is [now emeritus] professor of New Testament at Biblical Theological Seminary in Hatfield, Pennsylvania [now &lt;a href=&quot;https://missio.edu/&quot;&gt;Missio Seminary&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia], and director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibri.org/about/&quot;&gt;Interdisciplinary Biblical Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;a group of Christians who see a desperate need for men and women convinced of the complete reliability of the Bible who will: (1) get training both in Biblical studies and in some other academic discipline, and (2) use this training to help other Christians deal with the many areas where non-Christian teaching is so dominant today. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBRI is also thanked in the dedication of WDGDWI for its financial support. Wiester is [as of 2002] a part-time instructor in biology at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, and the chairman of the Science Education Commission of the American Scientific Affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WDGDWI purports to be “a friendly conversation about evolution” that “makes sense” of “Darwin, creationism, and intelligent design” for high school students; the conversation takes place between Professor Teller, “an advocate of Darwinism” (page vi), and Professor Questor, who disavows the label “creationist,” preferring instead to be known as a design theorist (page 7); the message implicit in their surnames is too obvious to require comment. It is instructive to compare Questor’s disavowal with what Newman wrote 25 years ago: “We advocate a third, intermediate view usually labeled ‘progressive creationism’” (Newman and Eckelmann 1977: 11). As late as 1999, he declared himself to be an old-earth, or progressive, creationist (Newman 1999: 105). Wiester is cagier about his allegiances, staunchly insisting that the issue is not between creationism and evolution but between Darwinism and intelligent design (Wiester 2000). But his &lt;i&gt;The Genesis Connection&lt;/i&gt; (Wiester 1992) is identified as a work of old-earth creationism by none other than his present collaborator (Newman 1999: 107n1). Still, WDGDWI proclaims, and largely complies with, the thesis that “[d]esign theory is not derived from religious authority nor from appeals to Scripture” (page 136).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before its publication, WDGDWI was heralded in various sectarian publications under several different names: &lt;i&gt;Darwin Ate My Homework&lt;/i&gt; (DeHaan and Wiester 1999: 65); &lt;i&gt;Darwinism for Skeptics&lt;/i&gt; ([Anonymous] 1999). I think that &lt;i&gt;Intelligent Design for Dummies&lt;/i&gt; would have been better (with due apologies to IDG Books Worldwide, the publisher of the “For Dummies” books). A pedant, Bertrand Russell quipped, is a man who likes his statements to be true; pedantry in Russell’s sense was in no way involved in the production of WDGDWI. I propose to remedy the lack by carefully examining Newman and Wiester’s treatment of the panda’s thumb, discussed on pages 72–78 of WDGDWI, which represents the general level of discussion of the book. Even in the limited space of these six pages, it becomes quite clear that, to paraphrase Gibbon’s observation about Augustine, their learning is too often borrowed, and their arguments are too often their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of the panda’s thumb begins when Teller, throwing up his hands, expostulates,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Well, even if you can raise some questions about whether Darwinism is the only way to explain living things, they certainly weren’t made by an all-wise God. Consider the panda, for example (page 72). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newman and Wiester then write, “According to Stephen Jay Gould, the panda’s thumb is proof of Darwinism. Imperfect design proves that the creative power at work is not intelligent” (page 73). WDGDWI is of course not a scholarly treatise and contains no footnotes — but remember Chick Publications’ comic book tract &lt;i&gt;Big Daddy?&lt;/i&gt;, which is replete with footnotes from the Institute for Creation Research and Kent Hovind? — but the appendix on background information refers to &lt;i&gt;The Panda’s Thumb&lt;/i&gt;, and presumably the first essay in it (Gould 1980). Newman and Wiester paraphrase Gould’s famous discussion, putting part of it in the mouth of Teller (and managing to reproduce the punctuation incorrectly, if harmlessly, in a verbatim quotation). Questor replies, “I have three problems with your story” (page 73).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questor quotes a passage from the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes (whose surprising presence here is discussed below) to the effect that the regularity of the seasons is evidence for intelligent design; schematically, Diogenes is arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The seasons are arranged in the best possible way. If something is arranged in the best possible way, then it was designed. Therefore, the seasons were designed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument elicits the following protest from Teller: “You can’t call it design just because it happens to fit your idea of the way it ought to be” (page 75). Questor then pounces: “My point exactly! Just because the thumb doesn’t fit Gould’s idea of what a thumb should be, how can he conclude that it isn’t designed?” Her point presumably is that if Teller objects to Diogenes’ argument, then he is committed to object to Gould’s argument — crudely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The panda’s thumb is not arranged in the best possible way. If something was designed, then it is arranged in the best possible way. Therefore, the panda’s thumb was not designed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— on the same grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teller’s response is ambiguous. To which premise of Diogenes’ argument is he objecting? If he is objecting to the second premise (that if something is arranged in the best possible way, then it was designed), as the wording of his protest suggests, then Questor’s contention that his objection applies to Gould’s argument is false. Gould’s argument uses, not the second premise of Diogenes’ argument, but its converse (that if something was designed, then it is arranged in the best possible way), which is not logically equivalent to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of a later description (page 76) of the issue as whether the panda’s thumb is “pleasing to a human observer,” it is perhaps plausible to take Teller as rejecting the first premise on the grounds that judgments about whether or not something is arranged “in the best possible way” are subjective, reflecting only matters of personal preference, and consequently not suitable data for scientific inquiry. But there is no necessity to construe the first premise of Gould’s argument as subjective; it is in principle possible to provide objective biomechanical criteria by which to assess his judgment that “[t]he sesamoid thumb wins no prize in an engineer’s derby” (Gould 1980: 24). (In fairness, if it is possible to provide objective criteria by which to evaluate the first premise of Diogenes’ argument, Teller should retract his objection to it; it is still open to him to reject the argument by rejecting its second premise.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the first problem, whatever it is, is spurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Secondly,” Questor continues, “your argument has a logical problem” (page 76). Scribbling on a handy blackboard, she represents Teller’s (and Gould’s) argument as follows (pages 76–77, emphasis in original).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1) If there is a God, He would be ABLE to make organisms with features that are pleasing to a human observer. 2) If he were ABLE to, he WOULD HAVE done so. 3) A practical example is that God would have given the pandas a real thumb. 4) Pandas do not have a real thumb. 5) Hence, God did not make the panda’s thumb. 6) Therefore, Darwinism, the only alternative, produced the thumb.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questor says that (1) is “debatable, moot, and probably irrelevant” (page 76), a charge remarkable for its vacuity. First, the word “moot” is ambiguous between “debatable” and “irrelevant”; either way, then, the charge is redundant. Second, no doubt (1) is debatable, but Questor chooses not to debate it: “debatable, moot, and probably irrelevant” is all she says. Third, if the task at hand is evaluating the soundness of the argument, (1) is hardly irrelevant: the argument is sound only if (1) is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just as well, however, that (1) receives no further attention from Questor, for neither Gould nor the hapless Teller asserted it. In both Gould’s argument and Teller’s version of it, what is under consideration is not whether certain biological features please human observers but whether certain biological features are optimally designed to accomplish their functions. The confusion here echoes the confusion about Teller’s objection to the first premise of Diogenes’ argument: the content of the premise is misrepresented, presumably because it is easier to attribute ineradicable subjectivity to our judgments about what is and is not pleasing than to our judgments about what is and is not optimally designed to accomplish its function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On premise (2), Questor comments, “That’s a theological proposition for which you have no evidence.” Leaving aside the oddity of Newman’s using “theological” as a term of objurgation when he teaches at Biblical Theological Seminary, what of it? Neither Gould nor Teller insists that the argument is wholly scientific in nature; hence there is no reason that they should be debarred from invoking theological propositions in their premises. As for whether there is evidence for (2), certainly any evidence for (2), or against (2), is not likely to be scientific, but again there is no reason to require it to be. As it stands, (2) is certainly in need of more support than it is given — the ancient problem of evil is implicated — but the question of its truth cannot simply be sidestepped by relegating it to the realm of theology. (Ironically, Questor argues similarly shortly thereafter: when Teller says, “Darwinism is still the best naturalistic theory we have,” Questor responds, “I want to know if it’s &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;” [page 78, emphasis in original].) The same remarks apply, mutatis mutandis, to premise (3), also said by Questor to be theological.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing, Questor says, “Premises 1–3 are purely theological. Statement 6 is not a conclusion. It’s a claim for which you provide no evidence. At best, it’s a faulty premise, and it’s certainly not justified by statements 1–4. Your conclusion might just as well have been, ‘Therefore, you drive a red car’” (page 77). Her judgment is noteworthy because it manifests Newman and Wiester’s failure to accord with their own exposition of argumentation (which, by the way, is itself rife with error). On page 29, they write, “In the study of logic, an ‘argument’ is a series of statements that tries to prove something,” and they add in a note that “the ‘something’ you’re trying to prove is usually called a &lt;i&gt;proposition&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;conclusion&lt;/i&gt;” (emphasis in original); the definition of “conclusion” is repeated on page 43. But clearly (6), by their definition, is a conclusion: it is the proposition that Teller is attempting to prove on the basis of the premises of the argument. Questor may believe that the argument to the conclusion (6) is unsound, but it is ludicrous to deny that it is indeed the conclusion of the argument. She fails to be even minimally consistent here: just two panels after denying that (6) is a conclusion, she refers to it as “your conclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of Questor’s, and presumably Newman and Wiester’s, confusion about whether (6) is a conclusion, is the argument for (6) valid, or is Questor right to detect a logical problem in it? The subconclusion (5), that God did not make the panda’s thumb, in fact follows validly from the premises, interpreted charitably. (For example, it is necessary to supply the implicit premise that real thumbs are, and the panda’s thumb is not, optimally designed.) As for the conclusion (6), that “Darwinism, the only alternative, produced the thumb,” it is laughably misexpressed. For “Darwinism” is defined as “the belief that undirected mechanistic processes (primarily random mutation and natural selection) can account for all the diverse and complex organisms that exist” (page 10); since the panda’s thumb long predates this belief, it could hardly have been produced by it. Of course, Newman and Wiester intended to say that “Darwinian processes, the only alternative, produced the thumb.” Appropriately revised, and adding the implicit premise that Darwinian processes are the only alternative to divine creation, (6) follows validly from (5), belying Questor’s claim that there is a logical problem with the argument. There is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a serious exegetical problem with the argument. For the premises entail not only that God did not make the panda’s thumb, but also that God does not exist. (Reduced to their essentials, the premises Questor presents are: if God exists, pandas would have real thumbs; pandas do not have real thumbs. It follows that God does not exist.) Needless to say, Gould’s original argument neither proved nor attempted to prove the nonexistence of God. Whether the unwarranted imputation of atheism to Gould’s argument is due to incompetence or malice, it is clearly a blatant misrepresentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem thus is also spurious; in addition, Newman and Wiester’s discussion of the argument for which it is supposed to be a problem verges on the incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Glenn Branch</name></author><summary type="html">Glenn Branch is deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit organization that defends the integrity of American science education against ideological interference. He is the author of numerous articles on evolution education and climate education, and obstacles to them, in such publications as Scientific American, American Educator, The American Biology Teacher, and the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, and the co-editor, with Eugenie C.

Stephen Jay Gould’s discussion of the panda’s thumb in his essay of the same name, originally published in 1978, is often misrepresented as describing the false thumb of Ailuropoda melanoleuca as ineffective in practice rather than as inelegant in origin. A recent incidence of such misrepresentation prompted Glenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education to provide his discussion of a similar misrepresentation in a 2000 cartoon presentation of intelligent design, originally published on the Metanexus: The Online Forum on Religion and Science website in two parts on August 15 and 16, 2002. The following appears here in conformity with Metanexus’s republication policy and with Branch’s permission. Minor changes, primarily regarding punctuation, have been made invisibly, and a few updates have been included in square brackets. This is part 1 of 2. Intelligent design, according to Michael Behe, must be ranked as one of the greatest achievements in the history of science. The discovery rivals those of Newton and Einstein, Lavoisier and Schrodinger, Pasteur, and Darwin. The observation of the intelligent design of life is as momentous as the observation that the earth goes around the sun or that disease is caused by bacteria or that radiation is emitted by quanta (Behe 1996: 232–233). Such a great scientific achievement, of course, deserves a careful exposition in a suitably scholarly format. But instead what it received is What’s Darwin Got to Do With It?

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel Eissenberg is Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. He is the author of the recent PT article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/04/how-humans-lost-tails.html&quot;&gt;How humans lost their tails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a college junior, I took a course in microbial genetics. The text was Gunter Stent’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Genetics-Introductory-Gunther-Stent/dp/0716710285&quot;&gt;Molecular Genetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. I map the beginning of my career as a geneticist to that course. Stent’s book is a history of the origins of molecular biology, and in retrospect, I believe it was the combination of the history and the science that beguiled me. This potent combination is on offer in Siddhartha Mukherjee’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Song-Cell-Exploration-Medicine-Human/dp/1982117354/&quot;&gt;The Song of the Cell&lt;/a&gt;: An Exploration of Medicine and the New Human&lt;/i&gt;. I generally avoid popular science books in my field, but this book was a gift from my daughter. I had read and enjoyed Mukherjee’s &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of all Maladies&lt;/i&gt;, so I was hoping for something special. I was not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factual information about cells and their roles in tissues and organs, and in disease were well established by the time most of us learned it in school, we mostly learned it by rote. Mukherjee uses the history of scientific discoveries about cells to show us not only each discovery, but also the context in which it was made and the impact it had on thinking at the time. Indeed, the book is chock-a-block with historical anecdotes. Many of these discoveries were controversial at the time, like germ theory as the basis for putrefaction and for disease. The esteemed evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr mocked Carl Woese’s proposal of Archea as a third kingdom of life; Mayr was wrong and Woese was vindicated. Even today, the origins of eukaryotic cells are still controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mukherjee is a marvelous storyteller. For example, he tells the story that when lipids were extracted from a carefully measured number of red blood cells and spread out on a surface, the area was twice that necessary to contain that number of cells, pointing to a lipid bilayer, rather than monolayer. He is very effective at explaining how discoveries emerge at the confluence of scientific disciplines; e.g., the marriage of microscopy and biochemistry to define the functions of various organelles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the evolutionary biologist, Mukherjee discusses the evolution of multicellularity from free-living single cells. As a model, he describes experiments that selected for multicellular clusters of budding yeast. As the clusters grew larger and larger, a subset of cells appeared across the center of the cluster and underwent apoptosis (cellular suicide) to divide the single cluster into two smaller clusters. While certainly artificial, these experiments demonstrate how selection can result in the acquisition of a new property resembling multicellular cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a set-up for a discussion of the community of cells we call embryos. There is a lovingly detailed description of the Spemann-Mangold discovery of the early embryonic “organizer.” The narrative then pivots to describe the infamous case of the anti-anxiety drug thalomide and its teratogenic side effects. The hero of that story was Frances Kelsey, Chief of the Division of New Drugs when Merrell sought to market thalidomide in the US as a sedative. She stood as the lone bulwark against the approval of thalidomide, thus preventing unnumbered birth defects, miscarriages, and stillbirths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mukherjee is a hematologist, so blood cells enjoy pride of place in this book. Blood transfusion was the first cellular therapy. It advanced modern surgery, safe childbirth, and cancer chemotherapy. There is an interesting history of blood clotting and the discovery of its role in heart attacks. The topic of immunology is launched with the ancient history of inoculation for smallpox (a.k.a., variolation) and its western descendant, Jenner’s vaccine. Until I read this book, I didn’t know that the history of antibody discovery began with Paul Ehrlich, who coined the word antibody, and immunity to snake venom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of how antibody diversity arises was a vexed one for decades, and Mukherjee has an amusing digression on the topic involving Linus Pauling. (A bit of personal history: the problem of antibody diversity was still unsolved when I was a microbiology major in college, and resulted in my aborted infatuation with immunogenetics. Fortunately, the mechanism was worked out by Susumu Tonegawa before I got too far into the weeds, and I went in a different genetics direction.) The complex cell biology of the immune response can be overwhelming, but Mukherjee brings the narrative within grasp using metaphors, engaging anecdotes and lively turns of phrase, while either eliding distracting details or relegating them to footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of César Milstein’s invention of hybridomas—fusions of B-cells (a type of white blood cell) and tumor cells—and the resulting monoclonal antibodies at Cambridge University is a riveting one, intimately bound up with the lethal politics of Argentina at the time. Mukherjee notes that the UK government failed to patent this transformative technology in the belief that it would have no immediate practical application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aspect of immunology that I’ve always found daunting is T-cell biology. T-cells are another type of white blood cell, and Mukherjee does a superb job of simplifying this branch of immunology without dumbing it down. Key to the cell-cell communication that underpins immunity is distinguishing self from non-self. The puzzle of how this works was solved through a combination of genetics, cell biology, and structural biology, and it makes for engrossing reading. Mukherjee shows how this knowledge is now being harnessed for new anti-cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our immune system is in an ongoing arms race with pathogens. How this arms race played out with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic is dramatically narrated. In some patients, the infection triggered a massive cellular over-reaction in the form of a cytokine storm—a hyperactive and dysfunctional inflammatory response that killed patients. As someone who enrolled in the Phase III Moderna trial, I remember hoping I’d be in the vaccine wing of the blinded trial. I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From blood, the narrative shifts to organs. How the heart muscle contracts and how it coordinates the contractions are designed into its cells. The cellular organization of neurons in the brain was only beginning to be understood at the end of the 19th century, a testament to advances in histological staining and microscopy. That nerves were conduits for electrical impulses became clear by the 1930’s. But detailed histology showed that nerve cells were not physically joined like wires, but separated by small gaps. Mukherjee describes the simple but elegant experiments that led to the discovery of acetylcholine as a chemical neurotransmitter that bridged the gaps between these cells. He speculates on how a system of wires modulated by chemicals might have evolved. In addition to neurons, our brains have glial cells that perform several roles, among them sculpting the connections between neurons. Mukherjee then tells a personal story of his bout of clinical depression to connect us personally with the role of serotonin in regulating mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section on the pancreas includes a cinematic description of the original dog experiments by Banting and Best; these led to the discovery of insulin, which is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. After decades of work, clinical trials using stem cells forced to differentiate into beta cells are proving therapeutic in Type I diabetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stem cells get their own chapter. Mukherjee begins poignantly by describing the victims of the Hiroshima atom bomb who survived the initial blast and the radiation sickness, only to sicken and die of anemia and loss of immune cells due to death of the stem cells in the bone marrow. Interest in stem cells began in the 19th century, but by the early 20th century it had given way to other aspects of cell biology. It was radiation biology that revived stem cell research in the 1950’s. From studies of bone marrow transplantation in irradiated mice emerged the unexpected finding that all blood cells originated from a single rare—one in ten thousand—precursor cell in the marrow. By 1960, the first successful human bone marrow transplant, and thus the first stem cell therapy, had been performed. In this case, the donor was an identical twin, and it took many years and many patient deaths to work out how to use unrelated donors successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mukherjee points out that cancer cells have properties shared with stem cells. He discusses evidence that stem cells can become cancer cells, and that some cancers contain “cancer stem cells” that renew the cancer after chemotherapy in analogy to the way that healthy stem cells renew organs and tissue during our lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why are we built from cells? Mukherjee says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recall that unicellular organisms evolved into multicellular organisms—not just once but many independent times. The driving forces that goaded that evolution, we think, were the capacity to escape predation, the ability to compete more effectively for scarce resources, and to conserve energy by specialization and diversification. Unitary blocks—cells—found mechanisms to achieve this specialization and diversification by combining common programs (metabolism, protein synthesis, waste disposal) with specialized programs (contractility in the case of muscle cells, or insulin-secreting capacity in pancreatic beta cells). Cells coalesced, repurposed, diversified—and conquered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t do justice in this review to a book that so effectively and seamlessly melds science, history, and philosophy. Science is more than collecting facts. It is a human endeavor of experience and interpretation. While I was well acquainted with most of the factual content in this book, the writing revitalized this familiar territory as a charming and engaging new synthesis, like listening to fresh improvisations on familiar jazz standards.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel Eissenberg is a professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. His research interests include transcriptional control of gene expression and vesicle trafficking. He has had a lifelong fascination with genomics and with developmental biology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10901737/pdf/41586_2024_Article_7095.pdf&quot;&gt; Xia et al.&lt;/a&gt; offer a mechanistic explanation for tail-loss evolution in humans and anthropomorphous apes. It turns out that loss of a tail is caused by loss of a gene function among the tailless primates. And as the paper shows, this evolutionary transition was mediated by transposable elements, that is, repeated parasitic DNA fragments that are found in all living things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point of the study was the comparative anatomy of a certain locus known as TBXT in tail-bearing simians and tailless apes. All simians display a copy of a short DNA sequence, called Alu, in the middle of the gene. Alu elements are the most abundant transposable elements (“jumping genes”) in the human genome; they first appeared about 65 million years ago and are widely dispersed throughout our genomes. Copies of Alu frequently interrupt genes with no apparent consequences. But in tailless apes, there’s an additional copy of Alu a little farther down and in the mirror image orientation from the copy common to all simians. The hypothesis driving this paper is that the Alu elements pair with one another, causing some of the information produced by the gene to be omitted by interfering with proper expression. Tailless primates express both this defective gene product and full-length TBXT gene products. The inference is that transposable-element–mediated defects in TBXT gene function underlies the evolutionary loss of external tails in hominoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists should perhaps note that the authors set out to test their conjecture using genetically engineered mice. Simply deleting the region between the human transposable elements in the mouse version of TBXT results in mice with variable truncation of tail length. The next step was to test whether inserting the human transposable element sequences in the mouse at the corresponding sites of the mouse TBXT gene recapitulates human taillessness. To further test whether it was the Alu sequences per se that mattered, mice were engineered with repeated DNA sequences of the same length as Alu, but unrelated in sequence at the sites and orientations corresponding to the human transposable elements. The point was to test whether there’s something special about the Alu sequences or whether any DNA sequence of similar length and positioned at the same sites in mirror image symmetry will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mice engineered such that their own TBXT gene was flanked by human Alu sequences in a fashion resembling the situation at the human TBXT locus, their descendants showed normal tails. Interestingly, descendants of mice engineered with the flanking repeat sequences unrelated to Alu had tails 10% shorter than wild-type mice. Detailed analysis of gene expression suggested that the ratio of normal to abnormal gene products was important to tail truncation. Further crosses generated mice with a combination of gene products that resulted in tailless mice. The upshot of all this is that (1) the chance insertion of a second Alu element in the common ancestor of tailed and tailless simians can explain the loss of external tails in the latter, and (2) the pairing of inverted copies of DNA sequence repeats accounts for the aberrant TBXT gene products – not some special property of Alu sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of transposable elements as sculptors of genomes is not a new one. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the ends of chromosomes are maintained by transposable elements. The Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert proposed that some genes evolved from pieces of transposable elements. In this study, we see yet more evidence that transposable elements can drive evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel Eissenberg</name></author><summary type="html">Cartoon depiction of two Alu elements in mirror-image orientation flanking an interval of chromosomal DNA (“Spacer”).

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bishop Wilberforce, in 1860, was a &lt;i&gt;skeptic&lt;/i&gt;, praised by Darwin for the skill of his questioning. Today’s creationists, not least the Discovery Institute, are &lt;i&gt;denialists&lt;/i&gt;, endlessly asking the same questions as he did, although they have long since been answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Bishop Wilberforce really did ask T.H. Huxley, “Darwin’s bulldog,” whether he would prefer an ape for his grandfather, and a woman for his grandmother, or a man for his grandfather, and an ape for his grandmother. And Huxley really did say that he would prefer this to descent from a man conspicuous for his talents and eloquence, but who misused his gifts to ridicule science and obscure the light of truth. This and more at the very first public debate regarding Darwin’s work on evolution, only months after the publication of &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first wrote the above paragraph in &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2017/10/huxley-wilberforce-darwin-apes-and-grandparents-a-victorian-scandal-revisited.html&quot;&gt;3 Quarks Daily&lt;/a&gt;  in 2017, shortly after &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsnr.2016.0058&quot;&gt;Richard England had published&lt;/a&gt; on the way that the events had been described in the &lt;i&gt;Oxford Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, the fullest contemporary account available of the encounter. That account refuted doubts that had been raised &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by some historians, and which I had seen referred to by creationists, wishing to minimise the episode or even to regard it as legendary. These doubts were based largely on the absence of the episode from the account in the gentlemanly &lt;i&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/i&gt;, but England convincingly showed that the &lt;i&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/i&gt; had practised censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing about this again today in response to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2024/02/what-really-happened-at-the-huxley-wilberforce-debate/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the mendaciously mistitled &lt;i&gt;Evolution News&lt;/i&gt;, mouthpiece of the neocreationist Discovery Institute, by Robert Shedinger, Professor of Religion at Luther College, Iowa. Shedinger has discovered a second career dissing Darwin. He is best known to readers here for his recent book, &lt;i&gt;Darwin’s Bluff&lt;/i&gt;, where he argues that Darwin’s voluminous unpublished notes demonstrate his inability to support his views, and the article I am discussing is an extract from that book. We must therefore regard it, not as a mere passing comment, but as the author’s considered opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shedinger starts by telling us that the reality is more nuanced than the well-known account, by deliberately muddling it with the crude version in which “the serious scientist and man of reason who won the debate over the unreasoning bishop who was unable to accept evidence when it flew in the face of church doctrine.” He cites the &lt;i&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/i&gt;, acknowledges England’s account (which he describes as “overlooked,” although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/metrics/10.1098/rsnr.2016.0058&quot;&gt;Royal Society tells us&lt;/a&gt;  that the article has been downloaded more than 3000 times), and reminds us as England did that the &lt;i&gt;Oxford Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; was a liberal publication that had criticised Wilberforce before. He then spends considerable time establishing that from a contemporary point of view, it was Hooker rather than Huxley who had been Darwin’s most prominent defender. Since I don’t think anyone would disagree, and nothing much hangs on it, why does he bother to do this? I suspect the influence of the Down With Huxley movement, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/th-huxleys-legacy-a-campus-building-renaming-controversy-and-appeal-for-signatures/&quot;&gt;recently succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in removing his name from the Environmental Sciences Building in Western Washington University, and came &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2022/03/29/damage-limitation-at-imperial/&quot;&gt;perilously close&lt;/a&gt; to inflicting comparable damage on Imperial College, which of course Huxley had helped found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Shedinger regrets that because of this episode, Wilberforce is widely ridiculed, and his criticism of Darwin not taken seriously. To the extent that this actually happens, I agree. So would Darwin, who himself wrote of Wilberforce’s article in &lt;i&gt;Quarterly Review&lt;/i&gt; (freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/wilberforce.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; It is uncommonly clever. It picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the ‘Anti-Jacobin’ versus my Grandfather.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin even recommended Wilberforce’s article to his local vicar, who was a long-time friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Shedinger’s main motive is to repeat Wilberforce’s arguments and claim that they have not been answered. Since my quarrel is with him, and not with Wilberforce, I will simply take material from his article and comment on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Wilberforce is not averse to the doctrine of evolution by natural selection should the evidence weigh clearly in its favor. He even acknowledges not only that organisms vary, but also that natural selection has led to great diversity within specific types. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Wilberforce is putting forward the creationist doctrine that allows evolutionary change up to a point. He was probably influenced by Richard Owen’s theory of “body plans,” setting limits to such change. But it is not clear what those limits would be, or how they could be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, the struggle for life clearly exists, “and that it tends continually to lead the strong to exterminate the weak, we readily admit; and in this law we see a merciful provision against the deterioration, in a world apt to deteriorate, of the works of the Creator’s hands.” So natural selection for Wilberforce acts to maintain the fitness of species in their environment, thus preventing their deterioration. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilberforce recognises here what we might now call a negative or purifying role for natural selection, which he sees as acting against the general tendency to deteriorate (compare the present-day creationists’ invocation of entropy), but, like today’s Intelligent Design theorists, denies that it can play a more positive role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Shedinger writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darwin Fails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Wilberforce notes that what Darwin needs to show is that there is active in nature a power capable of accumulating favorable variations through successive generations toward the production of entirely new species. And on this point, according to Wilberforce, Darwin fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[The bold headline is Shedinger’s.] Remember that in 1860, there was already extensive evidence for common ancestry, in the form of nested families, deep homologies (Darwin mentions the hand of a man, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise and the wing of the bat), to some extent the fossil record, limited as it was, and everything else that is mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, Wilberforce is arguing that (to use modern terminology) Darwin has not shown that diversification beyond the species level can happen, even though Darwin’s book was one long argument to show that it &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; happened. To Darwin’s arguments we would now of course add an enormously richer fossil record, together with molecular phylogenies and their detailed similarity to phylogenies derived in other ways, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/&quot;&gt;additional overwhelming evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I would say that Wilberforce is making an important point. Darwin is telling us that these changes have happened, yet he has no convincing mechanism as to what processes could have produced them. This is indeed an unsatisfactory situation, and would remain so for the next 40 years. (Although there is nothing unusual here. When Newton put forward his theory of gravity, the objection was raised that there was no mechanism by which one massive body would influence another, and this conundrum remained unsolved until Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. In Darwin’s own lifetime, acceptance of Avogadro’s famous hypothesis regarding molecules was delayed, on the grounds that it required neutral hydrogen atoms to be bonded together, and there was no process that could explain this, nor would there be until the advent of quantum mechanics. And as Huxley himself pointed out at the time, it was known that light propagated as a wave, showing the properties of diffraction and polarisation, although no one then knew what these waves consisted of. Wilberforce’s argument is powerful, but not necessarily lethal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His scientific critique continues. “We think it difficult to find a theory fuller of assumptions; and of assumptions not grounded upon alleged facts in nature, but which are absolutely opposed to all the facts we have been able to observe.” In addition, the variations produced in domestic animals by breeders are selected because of their utility to people, not for the good of the animal. So artificial selection is simply irrelevant to what happens in nature. If natural selection is continually producing innumerable variations, where, Wilberforce asks, is the evidence for this in the geological record?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have the claim that evolution, or at any rate evolution as profound as the species level, has not been observed. A much more reasonable claim in 1860 than it is today. We continue to hear it, in the face of counterexamples, although today’s young earth creationism allows, and indeed requires, speciation within a “kind.” Next Wilberforce criticises Darwin for using artificial selection as evidence for the possibility of natural selection. Here I think we can say in all fairness that Wilberforce had missed the point. Darwinian evolution is driven by fitness for the environment, and this is just as true in artificial as in natural selection. The only difference is that in the case of artificial selection, one major element of fitness is the ability to satisfy the breeder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the argument from the inadequacy of the fossil record. I don’t know how adequate that argument was in 1860, but it was not long afterwards that Huxley was already able to infer, correctly, that birds were related to dinosaurs, while Archaeopteryx was first described in between editions of &lt;i&gt;Origins&lt;/i&gt;. Today, the argument is endlessly repeated on creationist sites, but lacks all conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Darwin recognized the seeming sudden appearance of complex animals during the Cambrian era — a feature of the geological record known today as the Cambrian explosion — and openly admitted that if a long line of diversification in Precambrian deposits failed to show up in the fossil record, his theory would be in ruins. Wilberforce took this concession and ran with it…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument that had force at the time, and is reiterated by today’s creationists, despite having been totally refuted by discoveries in the interim. Precambrian fossils are rare, but this is hardly surprising, since unmetamorphosed Precambrian sediments are rare, and the Precambrian fauna was predominantly soft-bodied. Stephen Meyer, Shedinger’s colleague at the Discovery Institute, has made a career out of misrepresenting what we now know about the Cambrian explosion. Here Shedinger refers us to Meyer and other creationist sources, but also to the genuinely scientific study, &lt;i&gt;The Cambrian Explosion: The Construction of Animal Biodiversity&lt;/i&gt;, Douglas H. Erwin and James W. Valentine (2013), as if in support of his thesis, although he must know that he is doing violence to their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wilberforce took this concession and ran with it. “Now it is proved to demonstration by Sir Roderick Murchison, and admitted by all geologists, that we possess these earlier formations, stretching over vast extents, perfectly unaltered, and exhibiting no signs of life.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did the ensuing decades make a fool of Wilberforce? In fact, the findings of modern paleontology substantially agree with Wilberforce here. The wealth of Precambrian transitional fossils that Darwin hoped would be discovered and so rescue his theory have remained persistently absent, despite assiduous efforts to locate them, and despite the fossil record having shown itself quite capable of preserving other Precambrian fossils.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the goalposts moving! In one sentence, Wilberforce is vindicated because of the total absence of a Precambrian fossil record. In the next, he is proven right because the fossil record does not have sufficient “wealth of transitional fossils” to “rescue his [Darwin’s] theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wilberforce further objected to Darwin’s handling of time, and accuses him of positing enormous stretches of time in places where his theory requires them, but then gathering up into a point the duration in which certain forms of life prevailed, thus obscuring the fact that, as the fossil record shows, many forms of life endured for many millions of years without undergoing substantial change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Darwin had only the crudest of comparative timescales, and could be accused of making the timescale fit his theory. But that issue is now of only historical interest. Wilberforce’s more serious argument continues to be used; how come, if on occasion evolution requires relatively rapid change over time, some species have persisted for millions of years more or less unchanged? The rebuttal is the simplest possible; why shouldn’t some species have stayed more or less the same, if they were well adapted to their habitat and their habitat was stable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, Wilberforce also objected to Darwin’s employment of facts: “Together with this large licence of assumption we notice in this book several instances of receiving as facts whatever seems to bear out the theory upon the slightest evidence, and rejecting summarily others, merely because they are fatal to it. We grieve to charge upon Mr. Darwin this freedom in handling facts, but truth extorts it from us.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilberforce is accusing Darwin of cherrypicking, and Shedinger is relaying the charge with apparent approval, but without showing us the evidence. On this occasion, I fear, the fault lies with Wilberforce. Consulting the actual text of Wilberforce’s review, I find that he gave no examples, but continued the above passage by saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the loose statements and unfounded speculations of this book should come from the author of the monograms on Cirripedes, and the writer, in the natural history of the Voyage of the 'Beagle,' of the paper on the Coral Reefs, is indeed a sad warning how far the love of a theory may seduce even a first-rate naturalist from the very articles of his creed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strongly stated accusation of deplorable bias and lack of judgement. Without supporting evidence, however, this is just so much hot air. Also worth noting is the care with which Wilberforce acknowledges, repeatedly in his review, Darwin’s position as a man of science. The same cannot be said for today’s creationists, from Henry Morris on, who minimise his contributions and deny his merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shedinger concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The stereotype portraying Wilberforce as the pompous bishop rejecting Darwin on theological grounds is easily dispelled by the scientifically informed, scientifically focused, and comprehensive nature of his lengthy review. Hooker may have accused Wilberforce of not understanding Darwin’s theory, but Wilberforce’s review suggests he understood it only too well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway message is clear. The overall thrust of Wilberforce’s arguments were sound, and Darwin fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried throughout this account to refute Wilberforce’s arguments, or at least the crude version of them offered by Shedinger, though I expect that for most readers here such refutation was unnecessary. It is more interesting to see how many of these arguments are still used today. The list is impressive; I show them here, together with the date when I think they became untenable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variation is possible, but only within types. Dead on arrival. Standard creationist argument today, accompanied since the 1940s by an elaborate theory of types, within which variation is possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Selection works only to remove unfavourable variations. Dead on arrival. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Selection is necessary because of the general tendency of things to degrade. True, since so many mutations are harmful, to the point of being tautologous. The observations that things tend to degrade is echoed in the claim, made by RED Clark in 1948 and repeated by Henry Morris in &lt;i&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/i&gt;, that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. We can regard this as dead on arrival, since it clearly does not apply to open systems far from equilibrium, or we can wait until the work of Prigogine from the 1950s onwards, showing that such systems actively generate novel structures. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Closely linked is the argument that there is no mechanism to explain advantageous novelty. Dead and buried by 1920, with the recognition of mutations and the development of population genetics. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Artificial selection is different from natural selection, and doesn’t count. Dead on arrival. To be fair, I have not come across present-day creationists using it. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Inadequacy of fossil record. This one will never die, since the creationists will always be able to point to gaps in the record, unaware of the fact that by complaining about gaps, they are effectively conceding the existence of the record. To my mind, two fossil discoveries more than any others refute this argument; Archaeopteryx described in 1861, and the Taung Child, described in 1925, now classified as a juvenile Australopithecine. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Absence of Precambrian fossils: the first Ediacaran fossils were reported in 1868, but discounted because of scepticism about the existence of a Precambrian biota, and their status was not recognised until 1955.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Fossil stromatolites in the early Archean were recognised from around 1980. However, the alleged absence of Precambrian fossils is completely separate from the question of what has happened in the next half billion years or so. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Existence of groups of organisms essentially unaltered over millions of years (note that the Bishop had no difficulty accepting millions of years; the popularisation of Young Earth creationism is a much more recent development): I would describe this as dead on arrival, since the refutation is so obvious. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Defenders of evolution do so out of belief, despite the evidence. This argument presupposes that the evidence for evolution is so unconvincing that it is only accepted because of bias. Dead on arrival. Dead, decaying, and stinking of nasty personal attack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, Shedinger’s article, and I must therefore presume the book from which it is a sample, is a stale and shoddy contribution to the voluminous anti-Darwin literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of hearing Genie Scott’s talk in Glasgow some years ago, with the title “What would Darwin say to today’s Creationists?”  Her answer was, “Haven’t you been paying attention during the last 156 years?” 156 should now be amended to 165, but apart from this, as Shedinger convincingly shows, her answer stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilberforce, faced with a new paradigm, was not convinced and mustered counterarguments, some of them at the time quite powerful. He was a skeptic. Whether he would have changed his mind over time, we will unfortunately never know, because of his death in a horseriding accident in 1873. What we do know is that within decades evolution, as opposed to separate creation, was the dominant paradigm even in ecclesiastical circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s creationists, presented as they are with a science of evolution that has met every test that Wilberforce could suggest and many others that he could not even imagine, are not skeptics but denialists. There’s a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that, in Kentucky, at least, “inclusive” means “Christian.” At least, that is what you might deduce from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/2023/12/08/what-is-the-kentucky-faith-trail/71842251007/&quot;&gt;article by Jolene Almendarez and
Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez&lt;/a&gt; in the Cincinnati &lt;i&gt;Enquirer&lt;/i&gt; late last year. The article announces the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentuckyfaithtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Kentucky Faith Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which is a self-guided road trip that will take you to 11 important faith-based sites, all of them Christian.* The program has received a $305,000 grant from the state. Its purpose, according to a press release of the northern Kentucky tourism organization, as paraphrased by the &lt;i&gt;Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;, is to “pay homage to the role religion plays in Kentucky’s identity.” It is also designed to promote religious tolerance and understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trail is designed to be inclusive, welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to embark on a shared journey of discovery and reflection[.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org&quot;&gt;Freedom from Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (FFRF) will have none of it. In an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/43493-don-t-promote-ark-encounter-and-creation-museum-ffrf-asks-state-of-kentucky&quot;&gt;Don’t promote Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, FFRF asks state of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, FFRF notes that all 11 sites are Christian sites, a fact which hardly makes the trail welcoming to people of all faiths and backgrounds. Worse, they note that two of the sites, “the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, are well known for spreading misinformation and promoting anti-science worldviews[.]” Here at PT, where we are perhaps more forthright, we would say they spread &lt;i&gt;disinformation&lt;/i&gt;, which is to say, deliberate misinformation. Additionally, unlike most of the others, they have no historical value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FFRF goes on to describe these two “museums” and notes that they are owned by Answers in Genesis (AIG), which they accurately describe as “an extreme evangelical Christian organization that spreads misinformation and scientifically inaccurate teachings about our world.” Homing in on AIG, they stress that the Northern Kentucky Convention &amp;amp; Visitors Bureau “must cease using taxpayer money to promote a Faith Trail that includes the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum” and conclude that “[b]y promoting exclusively Christian sites, including two sites that spread blatant misinformation, the Bureau is unconstitutionally favoring Christianity over all other faiths.” You may see the complete letter to the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffrf.org/uploads/files/Northern%20Kentucky%20CVB%2C%20KY%20LTR2.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The article announces the launch of the Kentucky Faith Trail, which is a self-guided road trip that will take you to 11 important faith-based sites, all of them Christian.* The program has received a $305,000 grant from the state. Its purpose, according to a press release of the northern Kentucky tourism organization, as paraphrased by the Enquirer, is to “pay homage to the role religion plays in Kentucky’s identity.” It is also designed to promote religious tolerance and understanding: The trail is designed to be inclusive, welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to embark on a shared journey of discovery and reflection[.] The Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) will have none of it. In an article entitled Don’t promote Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, FFRF asks state of Kentucky, FFRF notes that all 11 sites are Christian sites, a fact which hardly makes the trail welcoming to people of all faiths and backgrounds. Worse, they note that two of the sites, “the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum, are well known for spreading misinformation and promoting anti-science worldviews[.]” Here at PT, where we are perhaps more forthright, we would say they spread disinformation, which is to say, deliberate misinformation. Additionally, unlike most of the others, they have no historical value. FFRF goes on to describe these two “museums” and notes that they are owned by Answers in Genesis (AIG), which they accurately describe as “an extreme evangelical Christian organization that spreads misinformation and scientifically inaccurate teachings about our world.” Homing in on AIG, they stress that the Northern Kentucky Convention &amp;amp; Visitors Bureau “must cease using taxpayer money to promote a Faith Trail that includes the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum” and conclude that “[b]y promoting exclusively Christian sites, including two sites that spread blatant misinformation, the Bureau is unconstitutionally favoring Christianity over all other faiths.” You may see the complete letter to the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau here. * Here, for the record, are the 11 attractions: Abbey of Gethsemani (sic), Ark Encounter, Basilica of St. Joseph Proto-Cathedral, Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, Creation Museum, Mother of God Catholic Church, Old Mud Meeting House (Dutch Reformed Church), Old Mulkey Meeting House, “Raccoon” John Smith’s Cabin, Red River Meeting House, South Union Shaker Village.</summary></entry></feed>
