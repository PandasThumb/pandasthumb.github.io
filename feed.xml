&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/04/25/cobb-and-comfort-on-the-contributions-of-rosalind-franklin-to-solving-the-structure-of-dna/&quot;&gt;Jerry Coyne reminds us&lt;/a&gt;, is the 70th anniversary of the publication of the structure of DNA in three &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; papers by Watson and Crick; Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson; and Franklin and Gosling. Coyne takes the opportunity to remind us that much of the “folklore” concerning Rosalind Franklin is false and based on a nearly fictional characterization written by James Watson, who frankly makes himself look like a fool. At any rate, it was Watson himself who initiated the conceit that a critical X-ray interferogram taken by Franklin had actually been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne cites new work by Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort showing that in fact neither Watson nor Crick himself saw the critical interferogram. Cobb is a biologist at Manchester and is writing a biography of Watson; Comfort is a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University and is writing a biography of Crick. The two collaborated and discovered that Watson and Crick had actually read a report, and that Franklin knew that Max Perutz had passed the report to them. Indeed, Franklin remained friends with Crick throughout the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this will be exactly shocking to anyone who has read &lt;i&gt;The Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix&lt;/i&gt;, by the scientist and historian Howard Markel. I reviewed the book on Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQ9BL2R1HJN1?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (it is a bad habit I occasionally indulge in). Franklin was a remarkable scientist who, as the Wikimedia caption notes, contributed to understanding the structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came away from Markel’s book with the impression that Watson had seen the X-ray interferogram, and Franklin was unaware that he had. The work of Cobb and Comfort suggests that in fact Watson had not seen the X-ray let alone stolen it. That said, the end of Markel’s book is a long, long interview with Watson, and I thought that Watson, for whatever reason, came across as knowing that he had not been entirely honest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.Wikimedia Commons.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post by Paul Callahan is copied from a series of comments that were posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/uncommondead.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and which we thought were fascinating but off-task. The comments document a discussion between Mr. Callahan and &lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt; (version 3.5) regarding young-earth creationism and intelligent-design creationism. We deemed them interesting and reproduce them here with Mr. Callahan’s permission. (He says: Note that this was ChatGPT 3.5, not 4, which is the latest public version. I haven’t tried it on that. I don’t think there will be much of a difference in substance.) Matt Young copied and pasted from the comments section and claims responsibility for any errors of transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Callahan&lt;/strong&gt; is a former academic computer scientist with about 25 years experience as a software engineer. He has a strong interest in evolution and emergent complexity, particularly cellular automata, and has contributed some new results about Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Callahan writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My intent here is not to play gotcha with ChatGPT 3.5. Large language models like this are a genuine breakthrough with many useful applications when used appropriately. I was curious how it would deal with the subject of creationism. I am mostly satisfied with its explanation of the scientific consensus on evolution. However, it was far too circumspect when it came to identifying creationism as a refuted belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played around to see how it would handle another false statement, which it had no problem identifying as false. I understand the distinction it's actually making. When I identify &quot;black is white&quot; as false, I am very unlikely to generate any controversy. By contrast, I will generate controversy when I identify as false &quot;the earth and its species were created in seven days as stated in Genesis.&quot; Yet both are refuted by empirical evidence. Conversely, both can be &quot;rescued&quot; by appealing to unfalsifiable beliefs. The only real distinction seems to be a constituency who will be offended. It's understandable that ChatGPT will try to be sensitive to people and their religious beliefs. So am I, usually. I only wish it was more forthcoming about the precise distinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herewith, the discussion between Mr. Callahan and ChatGPT. Mr. Callahan’s questions are flush left, and those of ChatGPT are indented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat on topic (yeah, it’s a stretch), I asked ChatGPT for its recollection of &lt;strong&gt;Uncommon Descent&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of a blog called Uncommon Descent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, Uncommon Descent is a blog that focuses on topics related to &lt;strong&gt;intelligent design&lt;/strong&gt; and is known for presenting arguments and viewpoints that support intelligent design as an alternative to evolutionary theory. The blog features posts written by various contributors who advocate for intelligent the, including some of the individuals mentioned earlier who are associated with the intelligent design movement. However, it's important to note that Uncommon Descent is not a peer-reviewed scientific publication, and its views are not widely accepted or considered scientifically valid by the mainstream scientific community. As with any source of information, it's important to critically evaluate the content and consider multiple perspectives, including those of the mainstream scientific community, when forming an understanding of complex scientific topics like intelligent design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to dock it some points for referring to ID as a “scientific topic,” but that’s a large language model for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid spamming further, here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1rRkfPcdePP4PaM9Jx1KSLSi2BFxMBKriScd_tjJVNPA%2Fedit%3A1_hegEh5KzA7O69j0n4IDQPgVts&amp;amp;cuid=4707939&quot;&gt;edited transcript of my conversation with ChatGPT inspired by this topic&lt;/a&gt;. I found that while it is clear in identifying evolution as the scientific consensus, it is possible to get it to spout creationism and ID simply by asking it to write fictitious speeches to church groups. Anyone who wants to go deep in the weeds can evaluate how these compare to the writing on creationist blogs. You probably could automate this even with guardrails just by setting a context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JimboK&lt;/strong&gt; then asked, “I don’t have an account on ChatGPT, so could you ask “it” for its description of “&lt;strong&gt;Creation Science&lt;/strong&gt;”? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I'd be happy to provide a description of &quot;Creation Science&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creation Science is a perspective or belief system that seeks to reconcile scientific and religious views of the origin of the universe, life, and humanity. It is often associated with certain branches of Christianity and holds that the account of creation as described in religious texts, such as the Bible, is a literal and accurate scientific explanation for the origin of the universe and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creation Science typically posits that the Earth and universe are relatively young, often adhering to a literal interpretation of the Bible's account of creation, which suggests that the Earth is around 6,000 to 10,000 years old. It may reject or challenge scientific theories such as evolution, the Big Bang theory, and geological dating methods that conflict with literal interpretations of religious texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of Creation Science often argue for the scientific validity of their views through interpretations of scientific data and evidence that they believe supports a literal interpretation of religious texts. However, these views are not widely accepted by the mainstream scientific community, which generally regards evolution and the Big Bang theory as well-supported scientific theories based on extensive evidence from multiple fields of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that Creation Science is considered by many to be a religious belief rather than a scientific theory, as it often relies heavily on faith-based interpretations of religious texts rather than empirical scientific methods. It has been a topic of debate and discussion among religious groups, educators, and scientists, and it continues to be a controversial and divisive issue in the intersection of science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Elzinga&lt;/strong&gt; asked, “The description reminds me of Creation Science back in the 1970s through the 1990s. It doesn’t include Gitt’s “In the beginning was information,” nor its tension with ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does ChatGPT use databases or use Google in compiling its summary of a topic? I haven’t tried it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Callahan responded, “I’ll let ChatGPT field both of those questions for you. This is a little risky because I haven’t tried it. On the second question, though, it’s a large language model, which is a type of deep learning network that trains on enormous sets of written text (basically anything it could find on the internet as of 2021). It is a predictive model, so it predicts statistically that if someone writes a question “What is the capital of Pennsylvania?” The most likely thing to follow will be something about Harrisburg. It is kind of amazing that this works so well. People have been trying to do it for decades but there is finally the computational power in the cloud as well as the size of datasets to form a meaningful predictive model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: The description reminds me of Creation Science back in the 1970s through the 1990s. It doesn’t include Gitt’s “In the beginning was information,” nor its tension with ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're correct. The description I provided is a general overview of Creation Science and does not encompass all the nuances and developments of the concept over time, including more recent perspectives such as those espoused by creationist and intelligent design (ID) proponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s through the 1990s, there were significant developments in the field of Creation Science, including the introduction of the concept of &quot;information&quot; as a key component in arguments against evolution. Proponents of Creation Science, including scholars like &lt;strong&gt;Werner Gitt&lt;/strong&gt;, argued that information, as evidenced in complex biological systems, cannot arise from natural processes and must be the result of an intelligent designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent Design (ID) is a concept that gained prominence in the late 20th century and is often associated with Creation Science. ID proponents argue that certain features of the natural world, including biological systems, are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than naturalistic processes. ID proponents often argue for the existence of an intelligent designer without explicitly naming it as a religious concept, in an attempt to present it as a scientific theory. However, the scientific validity of ID has been widely debated, with many scientists and educators regarding it as a form of creationism dressed in scientific language rather than a genuine scientific theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that Creation Science, including its relationship with ID, is not universally accepted within the scientific community and is often viewed as a controversial topic. Many scientists, educators, and proponents of mainstream science reject Creation Science and ID as unscientific and not supported by empirical evidence. The scientific consensus is that evolution and the Big Bang theory, among other well-established scientific theories, provide the most comprehensive and widely accepted explanations for the origin and development of the universe and life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ll note that it’s being far too diplomatic here but it can be asked the question in such way that it will be more definitive that the scientific consensus favors evolution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Does ChatGPT use databases or use Google in compiling its summary of a topic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not have direct access to external databases or the internet, including Google, to compile my responses. I do not have real-time access to up-to-date information beyond my knowledge cutoff date, which is September 2021. I generate responses based on the patterns and information learned during my training on a large corpus of text from the internet and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When providing information, I do not retrieve or reference specific sources, and my responses are generated based on patterns learned during training. I should not be considered as a primary source of authoritative or current information. Users should independently verify any information I provide with reliable sources, consult domain experts, or access up-to-date information from reputable sources for accurate and reliable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll add that ChatGPT has come under attack from the right, some of whom accuse it of being intentionally biased. It has guardrails against spouting hate or pseudoscience, so that does limit it a bit. Other than that, it has a pretty wide summary of what you will find as long as you do not limit yourself to Fox News and similar sources. It’s free for now (at least the more limited ChatGPT 3.5 release). I would recommend that anyone curious try it out for themselves: &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update. I had to add this: I thought this should be stated more forcefully: It’s important to note that Creation Science, including its relationship with ID, is not universally accepted within the scientific community and is often viewed as a controversial topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are correct. It is important to emphasize that Creation Science, including its relationship with Intelligent Design (ID), is not widely accepted within the scientific community and is often viewed as a controversial topic. The scientific consensus is that evolution, the Big Bang theory, and other established scientific theories provide the most comprehensive and widely accepted explanations for the origin and development of the universe and life on Earth, based on extensive evidence from multiple fields of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the majority of the scientific community regards Creation Science and ID as unscientific, as they often rely on faith-based interpretations of religious texts rather than empirical scientific methods. These perspectives are not considered mainstream scientific theories, and their validity and scientific rigor have been widely debated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to approach topics related to science and religion with critical thinking, an understanding of the scientific method, and an appreciation for the consensus of the scientific community. When seeking information on controversial topics, it is crucial to consult reputable sources, including peer-reviewed scientific journals and established scientific institutions, to obtain accurate and reliable information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After commenting that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox&quot;&gt;barber paradox&lt;/a&gt; probably would not make the computer “spark out and self-destruct,” Mr. Callahan asked: I agree with what you [ChatGPT] say, but I find it too diplomatic. It as if you wrote: “The assertion ‘black is white’ is not universally accepted within the scientific community, which generally regards these colors as distinct.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I strive to provide balanced and factual information while avoiding taking a position or promoting any particular viewpoint. I aim to provide a neutral and objective perspective based on widely accepted knowledge and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Creation Science, it's important to acknowledge that it is not supported by mainstream scientific evidence and methodologies, and it is not universally accepted within the scientific community. However, as with any topic, it's important to approach discussions with respect for diverse perspectives and engage in open and respectful dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using neutral language and avoiding taking a position on controversial topics is in line with the ethical guidelines and policies that govern the use of AI models to ensure responsible and unbiased communication. It's important to understand that AI models like ChatGPT do not hold opinions, beliefs, or biases, but rather generate responses based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you take a position on the assertion, “Black is white”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not hold opinions or take positions on any statements, including the assertion &quot;Black is white.&quot; This statement is factually incorrect and goes against commonly accepted definitions of colors. In the context of color perception and scientific understanding of colors, black and white are considered distinct colors with specific characteristics and properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that as an AI language model, I generate responses based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data, and I strive to provide factual and accurate information. It's always important to rely on credible sources and established knowledge when seeking information or discussing statements or assertions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that evolution is the only explanation for the diversity of life on earth that is well-supported by evidence, and that creation is at best an unfalsifiable belief that is entirely outside the scope of science. Thus, the assertions of “creation science” are just as factually incorrect as the assertion “black is white.” Note that the latter might also be supported by some unfalsifiable claims about human perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's widely accepted within the scientific community that the theory of evolution is a well-supported scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth, based on a large body of evidence from various fields of science, including biology, geology, genetics, and more. Evolution is considered a foundational concept in modern biology and is widely taught and accepted in scientific education and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, creationism, including the notion of &quot;creation science,&quot; is often considered a belief or philosophical position that is outside the scope of scientific inquiry, as it typically involves religious or metaphysical perspectives that are not based on empirical evidence or subject to scientific testing and falsification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that science is a self-correcting process that relies on evidence, experimentation, and peer review to establish and refine our understanding of the natural world. While individuals are entitled to their personal beliefs, it's crucial to distinguish between scientific knowledge, which is based on empirical evidence and subject to rigorous testing and verification, and other forms of belief or opinion that may not meet the criteria of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions, but I aim to provide information that is based on widely accepted scientific knowledge and understanding. It's always important to rely on credible sources and established scientific consensus when discussing scientific topics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to claim that indeed “black is white.” My belief is that we only know about these things through human perception. Human perception is provably faulty. Thus, it may be that every time we perceived distinct colors or read the distinction through other means (photodetectors) our interpretation was faulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assertion that &quot;black is white&quot; would likely be considered a non-factual statement based on our current understanding of color perception and the properties of black and white as distinct colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's true that human perception, including color perception, is subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as lighting conditions, individual differences in perception, and other variables, it does not necessarily imply that black and white are not distinct colors in the conventional sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of science, including the study of color perception, there are established principles, theories, and empirical evidence that guide our understanding of how color works in the natural world. These principles are based on extensive research, experimentation, and scientific consensus, and provide a reliable framework for understanding the physical properties of colors, including black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between subjective beliefs or interpretations and established scientific knowledge when discussing factual statements. While perceptions and interpretations can vary among individuals, the scientific method and empirical evidence provide a rigorous and reliable approach for understanding the natural world to the best of our current knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you respect my diverse perspective that black is in fact white?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs, opinions, or perspectives. My responses are generated based on patterns learned from a large corpus of text data, and I strive to provide factual and evidence-based information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement that &quot;black is white&quot; goes against established scientific knowledge and our understanding of color perception. It is not supported by empirical evidence, principles of physics, or established scientific theories. While diverse perspectives and opinions are important, it is also essential to differentiate between subjective beliefs and established factual information based on scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, my responses are guided by a commitment to accuracy, reliability, and adherence to established knowledge. I aim to provide information that is based on sound scientific principles and widely accepted facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that you are given [sic] more respect to creationism as “diverse perspective” than you give to my claim above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I strive to provide impartial and unbiased responses. However, it is important to note that while diverse perspectives are valued, they are not all equal in terms of their scientific validity or evidence-based support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion that &quot;black is white&quot; is not supported by established scientific knowledge and is contrary to our understanding of color perception, physics, and empirical evidence. It would be misleading to equate it with a diverse perspective on a topic that is based on credible scientific evidence, such as the theory of evolution, which is supported by extensive scientific research and evidence from various fields of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between subjective beliefs or opinions and scientifically supported facts when discussing scientific topics. While diverse perspectives and opinions are important, scientific validity is determined by empirical evidence, peer-reviewed research, and the consensus of the scientific community. As an AI language model, my responses are guided by established knowledge and evidence-based information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but creationism is not based on credible scientific evidence. Yet you treat it deferentially with phrases such as “not widely accepted” as opposed to “factually wrong.” I would use the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand your perspective. It is important to note that as an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs. My responses are generated based on patterns learned from a large corpus of text data and are intended to be informative and unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the topic of creationism, while it is a belief held by some individuals, it is not widely accepted within the scientific community as a credible scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. The scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution as the most well-supported and evidence-based explanation for the diversity of life on our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to use accurate and precise language when discussing scientific topics. While &quot;not widely accepted&quot; may be a diplomatic way to describe the lack of scientific support for creationism, it is indeed a fact that creationism is not supported by credible scientific evidence and is considered by many scientists and researchers as incompatible with established scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to critically evaluate and differentiate between scientific facts, evidence-based theories, and subjective beliefs or opinions when discussing scientific topics. This helps to ensure accuracy and clarity in communication and promotes a better understanding of scientific concepts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that creationism is factually wrong and stands in contradiction of a preponderance of evidence and scientific analysis carried out for over 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs. However, it is important to note that creationism, as a belief that rejects or contradicts established scientific theories such as evolution, is not supported by credible scientific evidence and is not widely accepted within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory of evolution, supported by a vast body of scientific evidence from diverse fields such as biology, genetics, geology, and comparative anatomy, is considered the most well-supported scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. It is widely accepted by the scientific community and has been extensively researched, analyzed, and refined over more than 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While individuals may hold personal beliefs or opinions that differ from scientific consensus, it is important to recognize that scientific theories are based on empirical evidence, rigorous testing, and peer-reviewed research. In the context of science, a theory represents the best available explanation based on the available evidence and is subject to revision or abandonment in light of new evidence. As such, it is scientifically accurate to state that creationism is not supported by credible scientific evidence and contradicts the well-established scientific theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it accurate to call creationism factually wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs, and I strive to provide information based on credible sources and established scientific consensus. The term &quot;factually wrong&quot; is subjective and can be seen as a value judgment. In the context of scientific consensus, creationism, as a belief that rejects or contradicts established scientific theories such as evolution, is not supported by credible scientific evidence and is not widely accepted within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the overwhelming body of scientific evidence, the theory of evolution is considered the most well-supported scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. It is widely accepted by the scientific community and has been extensively researched, analyzed, and refined over more than 150 years. In this scientific context, creationism, which proposes supernatural or religious explanations for the origin and diversity of life, is not considered scientifically valid or supported by credible evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to recognize that science is a self-correcting process based on empirical evidence, rigorous testing, and peer-reviewed research. Scientific theories are subject to revision or abandonment in light of new evidence. However, the established scientific consensus based on the preponderance of evidence currently supports the theory of evolution as the most scientifically accurate explanation for the diversity of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it accurate to call the assertion “black is white” factually wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it would be accurate to call the assertion &quot;black is white&quot; factually wrong based on established definitions and understanding of colors within the framework of human perception and scientific knowledge. In the standard understanding of colors, black and white are considered distinct and opposite, with black being the absence of light or color, and white being the presence of all colors or a combination of all colors of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While human perception can have limitations and individual interpretations may vary, within the established scientific understanding of colors, the assertion &quot;black is white&quot; would be considered factually incorrect. It would go against established definitions, principles of physics, and scientific knowledge related to colors, light, and human perception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you I see that as a value judgment? For example, it is based on an overoptimistic view of human perception, and it also suggests a preference for falsifiable claims and disregards my belief that black really is white and we have simply failed to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or preferences. However, I can provide an objective response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion &quot;black is white&quot; is not supported by established definitions, principles of physics, and scientific knowledge related to colors, light, and human perception. It would be considered factually incorrect based on our current understanding of these concepts. Scientific understanding is based on empirical evidence, testable hypotheses, and the scientific method, which involves the rigorous evaluation of claims using evidence, logic, and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While individuals may have personal beliefs or perspectives, it is important to note that in the realm of science, falsifiable claims, evidence-based reasoning, and established principles are the basis for our understanding of the natural world. Claims that lack credible evidence or go against established scientific knowledge are generally not considered scientifically valid. It is important to distinguish between personal beliefs and scientific facts when discussing matters related to science and evidence-based reasoning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Callahan</name></author><summary type="html">Alice and the White Queen, drawn by the author with the assistance of an AI (or perhaps it was the other way around). This post by Paul Callahan is copied from a series of comments that were posted here and which we thought were fascinating but off-task. The comments document a discussion between Mr. Callahan and ChatGPT (version 3.5) regarding young-earth creationism and intelligent-design creationism. We deemed them interesting and reproduce them here with Mr. Callahan’s permission. (He says: Note that this was ChatGPT 3.5, not 4, which is the latest public version. I haven’t tried it on that. I don’t think there will be much of a difference in substance.) Matt Young copied and pasted from the comments section and claims responsibility for any errors of transcription. Paul Callahan is a former academic computer scientist with about 25 years experience as a software engineer. He has a strong interest in evolution and emergent complexity, particularly cellular automata, and has contributed some new results about Conway’s Game of Life. Mr. Callahan writes, My intent here is not to play gotcha with ChatGPT 3.5. Large language models like this are a genuine breakthrough with many useful applications when used appropriately. I was curious how it would deal with the subject of creationism. I am mostly satisfied with its explanation of the scientific consensus on evolution. However, it was far too circumspect when it came to identifying creationism as a refuted belief. I played around to see how it would handle another false statement, which it had no problem identifying as false. I understand the distinction it's actually making. When I identify &quot;black is white&quot; as false, I am very unlikely to generate any controversy. By contrast, I will generate controversy when I identify as false &quot;the earth and its species were created in seven days as stated in Genesis.&quot; Yet both are refuted by empirical evidence. Conversely, both can be &quot;rescued&quot; by appealing to unfalsifiable beliefs. The only real distinction seems to be a constituency who will be offended. It's understandable that ChatGPT will try to be sensitive to people and their religious beliefs. So am I, usually. I only wish it was more forthcoming about the precise distinction. Herewith, the discussion between Mr. Callahan and ChatGPT. Mr. Callahan’s questions are flush left, and those of ChatGPT are indented. Somewhat on topic (yeah, it’s a stretch), I asked ChatGPT for its recollection of Uncommon Descent: Do you know of a blog called Uncommon Descent? Yes, Uncommon Descent is a blog that focuses on topics related to intelligent design and is known for presenting arguments and viewpoints that support intelligent design as an alternative to evolutionary theory. The blog features posts written by various contributors who advocate for intelligent the, including some of the individuals mentioned earlier who are associated with the intelligent design movement. However, it's important to note that Uncommon Descent is not a peer-reviewed scientific publication, and its views are not widely accepted or considered scientifically valid by the mainstream scientific community. As with any source of information, it's important to critically evaluate the content and consider multiple perspectives, including those of the mainstream scientific community, when forming an understanding of complex scientific topics like intelligent design. I have to dock it some points for referring to ID as a “scientific topic,” but that’s a large language model for you.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Buteo jamaicensis</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/Buteo-jamaicensis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Buteo jamaicensis" /><published>2023-04-24T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-04-24T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/Buteo-jamaicensis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/Buteo-jamaicensis.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;David Young&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ID-advocacy blog Uncommon Descent is dead (or maybe undead).  The blog was founded by 
William Dembski in April, 2005, the year of the Dover School Board case.  It became a central 
site for posts arguing for Intelligent Design, with the comment sections having arguments 
back and forth.  Many of the posts were by the ever-astonishing Denyse O’Leary, who took on this job, writing as “News”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Dembski withdrew from active participation in the site; its administration was
set up as a nonprofit organization. The Denver-area right-wing lawyer Barry Arrington 
took over administration of the site, ruling with an iron hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks UD had frequently been down.  This seems to be connected to what finally happened on April 12.  William Dembski posted an announcement that the site had been “archived” by the 
Discovery Institute and would be available in that form.  The front page layout changed, 
with links to posts and their comments but no way for anyone to post further comments.  Dembski’s post was a farewell to the site, in which he gave an account of its history and thanked 
the people who helped with it.  No further posts are expected to appear. 
The blog had died, and was only available in that form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;afterglow&quot;&gt;Afterglow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few days after, one could access a version of UD that was in its original form, and 
did not include Dembski’s farewell post.  Commenters continued to argue in the threads 
for recent posts, but these comments were not included in the archived versions.  No new 
posts appeared on that undead form.  I am told that there were two links in the DNS record 
for UD, corresponding to different forms of the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the undead version had not long to go.  It seems now to have vanished, and its recent 
comments with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-favorite-moments&quot;&gt;My favorite moments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many fond memories I have of UD.  I’ll just mention two (you are encouraged to 
tell us yours, in the comments below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indefensible&quot;&gt;Indefensible&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was a post by the late, lamented Gil Dodgen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-some-point-the-obvious-becomes-transparently-obvious-or-recognizing-the-forrest-with-alls-its-barbs-through-the-trees/&quot;&gt;(here)&lt;/a&gt; in 2011.  Forgetting the main meaning of the word “indefensible”, he declared that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At UD we have many brilliant ID apologists, and they continue to mount what I perceive as increasingly indefensible assaults on the creative powers of the Darwinian mechanism of random errors filtered by natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think he meant by “indefensible” that no one could mount a defense against the “assaults”).  Anyway, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/06/total-agreement.html&quot;&gt;rushed to agree&lt;/a&gt; here at PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-great-purge-of-2012&quot;&gt;The Great Purge of 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second favorite UD moment was Barry Arrington carrying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/why-is-barry-arringtonstifling-dissent-at-ud/&quot;&gt;the Great Purge of 2012&lt;/a&gt;.  Obviously 
irritated by having so many cogent opponents of ID in the comment section, he declared that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The issue, then, is not whether persons who disagree with us on the facts and logic will be allowed to debate on this site. Anyone who disagrees about the facts and logic is free to come here at any time. But if you come on here and say, essentially, that facts and logic do not matter, then we have no use for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declared that commenters were denying basic logical principles such as the Law of Non-Contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For that reason, I am today announcing a new moderation policy at UD. At any time the moderator reserves the right to ask the following question to any person who would comment or continue to comment on this site: “Can the moon exist and not exist at the same time and in the same formal relation?” The answer to this question is either “yes” or “no.” If the person gives any answer other than the single word “no,” he or she will immediately be deemed not worth arguing with and therefore banned from this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course lots of people thought immediately of the results of quantum mechanics, in which 
an object is actually a wave, and not necessarily located in one precise place.  They said “Well, 
actually, …” and were immediately banned.  Pro-evolution commenters were banned almost 
en masse.  Even some creationist commenters reacted that way … and they were banned too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most patient, temperate, polite, incisive, and logical pro-evolution commenters at UD was 
Elizabeth Liddle, a neuroscientist at the University of Nottingham in England.  She 
immediately made available her own blog &lt;a href=&quot;theskepticalzone.com/wp/&quot;&gt;The Skeptical Zone&lt;/a&gt; as 
a home for discussion by the banned and the unbanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later made a post about this hilarious purge (in 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/was-denial-of-the-laws-of-thought-a-myth/&quot;&gt;at The Skeptical Zone&lt;/a&gt;) asking whether 
anyone could actually point out any comments at UD where pro-evolution commenters rejected laws of logic.  No 
one could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrington must have realized that without any pro-evolution commentators the site would 
die of lack of interest, because he allowed some to remain after that, without 
getting too insistent on the existence of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;failures-to-stay-on-topic&quot;&gt;Failures to stay on-topic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say that most of the discussion at UD was about evolution 
and ID.  But the pro-ID and/or creationist participants seemed to feel 
that the basic issue was the existence of God, and their basic task was 
to refute atheism.  So much space was devoted to where the Universe 
came from, whether the laws of physics were fine-tuned for life, and 
whether there was any basis for morality if there was not a God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was an awful lot of off-topic posts and comments.  If the 
Universe is the result of fine-tuned laws, that makes it easier, 
not harder, to imagine that biological evolution occurred.  And the 
origin of the Universe or of morality has basically nothing to do 
with whether evolution occurred or whether Design Intervention must 
have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-tent&quot;&gt;The Big Tent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intelligent Design movement tries to maintain a “big tent”, 
and make its arguments attractive to people who reject 
Young-Earth Creationism.  They are offended by the thought that 
people think that they are YECs.  But at the same time they 
needed the political and financial backing of YEC folks. This 
creates dilemmas for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of the most active commenters at UD seemed to 
be YECs. This led to some commenters arguing that there 
was overwhelming evidence against “evolution”, while others 
were angry at us for even suggesting that ID advocates 
rejected evolution.  These folks never seemed to notice one 
another, let alone debate each other.  So much for deep thinking 
about evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough from me.  For those who paid attention to UD, what were 
your favorite moments?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Uncommon Descent sinks slowly in the west (Fair Use claimed) The ID-advocacy blog Uncommon Descent is dead (or maybe undead).

Moreover, he is trying to make it look as if the supposed “success” of the Ark Park has brought the new hotel to the region. Information below shows that AIG shares a high-level employee with the new hotel, and the LLC that owns the hotel shares a Post Office box with AIG.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Ham is being quiet on who owns the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/cvgarhx-hampton-suites-williamstown-ark-encounter/&quot;&gt; Hampton Inn hotel&lt;/a&gt; next to the Ark. It turns out that AIG is, in all probability, at least a partial owner. AIG has not stated their financial interest publicly.  How long will Ham keep quiet about AIG being a part-owner, or more, of the new hotel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 5, Ken Ham bragged that &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2023/03/05/new-hotel-opens-next-to-ark-encounter/&quot;&gt;a new hotel was being built next to the Ark Park parking lot&lt;/a&gt;. Ken was proud that he and select AIG staff were “offered” and given a tour of a new Hampton Inn hotel. It was not stated, but implied, that a new business, independent from AIG and Ark Encounter, was being brought to the region by the overwhelming success of the Ark. His tour is implied to have been given by an unnamed owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The address of this new Hampton Inn is 2 Skyway Drive, Williamstown, KY. According to the free portion of the Grant County PVA (Property Valuation Administrator) site, this property is owned by Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC (GTH) of Bellevue, Kentucky (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A site called Open Corporates has information on Kentucky Corporations (Figure 2). The Kentucky company address for the “Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC” is PO Box 510, Hebron, KY. Hebron is near the Creation Museum, the headquarters of Answers in Genesis. Lo and behold, &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/about/contact/&quot;&gt; AIG’s mailing address&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; PO Box 510, Hebron,! I noticed a familiar name on the GTH list of Directors/Officers - a Mr. Scott Fetzer (Figure 3). Mr. Fetzer is the Treasurer for Answers in Genesis as well as the Director of Life Action Ministries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-fetzer-58ab9938/&quot;&gt; Here&lt;/a&gt; is Mr. Fetzer’s LinkedIn page where he lists himself as being the Chief Financial Officer at Answers in Genesis since 2017.  Thus, the CFO of AIG is also an agent for the hotel’s corporation, GTH. Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC, is incorporated in Ohio, and online information about their owners or Articles of Incorporation were not available. A search of the Kentucky Secretary of State’s general information database showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.sos.ky.gov/ftshow/(S(jc2yera1rbcvj0kiku1rt5dc))/default.aspx?path=ftsearch&amp;amp;id=1170595&amp;amp;ct=06&amp;amp;cs=99999&amp;amp;ce=RCeknMkeMwkfvXIkIqla3qquI9dzfchxO8C20a%2bWpNXWyzYyco6t7fKdE5LWYlHV&quot;&gt;Great Tourism Hospitality is incorporated in Ohio and doing business in Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a different representative of Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC, appeared before a Williamstown City Council special meeting on September 23, 2021. The City Council unanimously gave permission to Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC, to begin clearing the property for hotel construction. According to the meeting minutes, the Ark &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms5.revize.com/revize/williamstown/Document_Center/Agendas%20&amp;amp;%20Minutes/2021/Minutes/09-23-21_CMS.pdf&quot;&gt; sold part of its parking lot&lt;/a&gt; for the Hampton Inn. This is interesting. Did the for-profit Ark Encounter sell the land to its owner, the non-profit Answers in Genesis? Answers in Genesis, a non-profit, now seems to be a part owner of the Hampton Inn.  What were the complexities of a non-profit selling this small parcel of property to a presumably for-profit hotel business that is at least partly owned by the non-profit? Was the hotel built on part of the nearly 100 acres of land Williamstown originally sold the Ark for $2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williamstown already has two rather old and outmoded hotels, the Sunrise Inn and America’s Best Value Inn. Additionally, there are numerous small bed-and-breakfast suites in and around Williamstown. What will the owners of these businesses think of the new competition? Back in 2011, when the Ark was trying to get various perks and incentives from Grant County and Williamstown, a public meeting was held. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/ark-encounter-l.html&quot;&gt; my account of the meeting&lt;/a&gt;, I noted that AIG representative Mike Zovath discussed how AIG was staying out of the hotel business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; According Zovath, the area will need many additional hotels and restaurants. According to the Beemer study, there will be enough visitors to justify twenty 100-room hotels in the area. Presently, there are very few hotels and restaurants in this rural area. Zovath said Ark Encounter will have 60 to 70 acres of their 800 acres available to developers to either lease or purchase for hotels and restaurants. Ark Encounter itself is staying out of the hotel and restaurant business. Zovath concluded, &quot;That's my story, I'm sticking to it.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks as if AIG has backed out of the promise not enter the hotel business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since AIG is at least a partial owner of the Williamstown Hampton Inn, will they discriminate in hiring? I cannot find any direct evidence on this. There are &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.google.com/search?q=jobs+at+hampton+inn+williamstown+ky&quot;&gt;jobs available&lt;/a&gt;, but they do not mention any religious requirements as do the Ark and the Creation Museum, both of which require a statement of faith and many more religious requirements for employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, will they let rooms to unmarried couples or gays? Will this business follow Hilton/Hampton Inn policies or AIG’s? Hilton, the owner of Hampton Inn franchises, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.hilton.com/~/media/Files/H/Hilton-Worldwide-IR-V3/committee-composition/human-rights-policy.pdf&quot;&gt;this policy&lt;/a&gt; . Would the Ark’s Hampton Inn lose their franchise if they discriminate? AIG’s policy concerning non-marital sex and gay sex in summarized in their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/&quot;&gt;Statement of Faith&lt;/a&gt;.” Specifically, AIG’s position in part is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The only legitimate marriage, based on the creation ordinance in Genesis 1 and 2, sanctioned by God is the joining of &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/about/definition-man-and-woman/&quot;&gt;one naturally born man and one naturally born woman&lt;/a&gt; in a single, exclusive union as delineated in Scripture. God intends sexual intimacy to only occur between a man and a woman who are married to each other and has commanded that no sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. Any form of &quot;sexual immorality,&quot; such as adultery, fornication, prostitution, homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, pornography, abuse, or any attempt to change one’s gender, or disagreement with one’s biological gender, is sinful and offensive to God (Genesis 1:27–28, 2:24; Matthew 5:27–30, 19:4-5; Mark 10:2–9; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11; 1 Thessalonians 4:3–7; Hebrews 13:4).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will AIG’s new Hampton Inn refuse guests that they do not approve of? In a controversial decision, the US Supreme Court recently ruled that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf&quot;&gt;private businesses can discriminate on religious grounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Ken Ham has been quiet on who owns the new hotel. He implies that it is being built because of the supposed grand success of the Ark Encounter. However, attendance at the Ark, as documented by monthly Kentucky Open Records Act requests for the 50 cent/ticket Safety Tax imposed by Williamstown, shows that they have &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; come close to attendance projections. Before the Ark opened in 2016, AIG was claiming 1.4 to 2.2 million people would be visiting the Ark every year. There is no available evidence that even one million tickets have sold per year and the data shows a continued downward trend in attendance. Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2023/02/25/exciting-update-offices-move-incredible-building/&quot;&gt;AIG bought the former headquarters of Toyota, USA&lt;/a&gt; in northern Kentucky for more than $31 million. With Ark and Creation Museum attendance being mediocre, how did they afford this?  AIG is highly likely to be receiving large donations from donors with deep pockets. I recently exposed how AIG has received at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/02/Funder-of-Super-Bowl.html&quot;&gt; $19 million in dark money&lt;/a&gt; from the Servant Foundation via “donor advised funds.” Perhaps AIG has received additional donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest chapter in AIG’s history in Kentucky shows the duplicitous nature of their activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Phelps</name></author><summary type="html">Summary: Ken Ham is being quiet that Answers in Genesis (AIG) owns part, or perhaps all, of the new Hampton Inn that just opened adjacent to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky. Moreover, he is trying to make it look as if the supposed “success” of the Ark Park has brought the new hotel to the region. Information below shows that AIG shares a high-level employee with the new hotel, and the LLC that owns the hotel shares a Post Office box with AIG. Ken Ham is being quiet on who owns the new Hampton Inn hotel next to the Ark. It turns out that AIG is, in all probability, at least a partial owner. AIG has not stated their financial interest publicly. How long will Ham keep quiet about AIG being a part-owner, or more, of the new hotel? On March 5, Ken Ham bragged that a new hotel was being built next to the Ark Park parking lot. Ken was proud that he and select AIG staff were “offered” and given a tour of a new Hampton Inn hotel. It was not stated, but implied, that a new business, independent from AIG and Ark Encounter, was being brought to the region by the overwhelming success of the Ark. His tour is implied to have been given by an unnamed owner. The address of this new Hampton Inn is 2 Skyway Drive, Williamstown, KY. According to the free portion of the Grant County PVA (Property Valuation Administrator) site, this property is owned by Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC (GTH) of Bellevue, Kentucky (Figure 1).

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“P hacking” is a form of cheating, whether inadvertent or advertent.  You test a bunch of chemicals on rats to see whether they cause, say weight loss.  You do a statistical 
test on each, to see whether there is significant evidence for weight loss.  The 
results are judged by the probability &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; that evidence this strong would arise by 
chance, if there were actually no effect.  You use a small probability, say 0.05, 
as a sign that the effect is real.  But suppose that you have 100 different chemicals, and do 100 separate tests.  If none of these chemicals have any actual effect, what 
is the chance that none of the tests will have &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; smaller than 0.05?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is easy to compute: it is 0.95&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 0.00592.  The chance that at least one of the 100 tests shows a value of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; below 0.05 is actually 0.99408.  If what you do is pick that test (or tests) and write a scientific paper reporting the 
effectiveness of that chemical, you will be committing P-hacking.  If none of the 
chemicals actually works, over 99% of the time you will be able to announce that you have found a weight-loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is relevant to evaluating the meaning of a mathematical paper in the ID journal &lt;em&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/em&gt; in 2018.  It is by George Montañez, a computer scientist at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California.  It contains mathematical proofs that concepts of Specified Complexity can be considered in a unified way.  The unstated 
implication is that with natural evolutionary processes, high levels of Specified Complexity cannot be expected.  Montañez’s paper can be found 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2018.4/BIO-C.2018.4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I bringing up P-hacking?  Not to accuse Montañez of it.  In fact, the 
opposite.  It is to point out that natural selection acts like P-hacking. 
Let me explain, first what Montañez’s paper does, then what it says about demonstrating Design, 
and finally how natural selection’s “P hacking” makes that difficult:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;montañezs-paper&quot;&gt;Montañez’s paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montañez’s paper in &lt;em&gt;BIO-Complexity&lt;/em&gt; is a detailed mathematical treatment of how one can make a unified 
mathematical framework for computing a quantity, Specified Complexity, one which brings together Dembski’s original 
argument, algorithmic specified complexity, and irreducible complexity arguments.  I don’t find any mathematical 
errors in it.  (For those interested: he uses a combination of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma with a distribution 
constructed from a rescaling of the specification function to have unit area under it.  From this he finds a 
rejection region for the null hypothesis.  He covers multiple cases. The likelihood ratio needed in the Neyman-Pearson 
lemma is the ratio of this artificial distribution to the distribution under the null hypothesis.  He calls that 
ratio the “kardis”, for which see the figure caption above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-he-suggests-demonstrating-design&quot;&gt;How he suggests demonstrating design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montañez does discuss testing Design, which, like all ID advocates, he equates with rejecting the 
hypothesis that the degree of adaptation, or, more mysteriously, the algorithmic simplicity of something-or-other, 
can be accounted for by natural processes.  (For a lengthy rant by me on why the algorithmic simplicity argument 
seems to make no sense, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html&quot;&gt;an earlier post by me&lt;/a&gt;).  For Montañez, natural processes may be rejected if we do not 
have big enough probabilities of the observed adaptations when natural processes operate.  The burden of proof is on the biologists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; is the entry fee for a probabilistic mechanism to even enter the tournament of competing explanations (Montañez, 2018, Section 6.1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No similar criterion is proposed for Design explanations to enter this tournament.  In effect, this is simply the 
common taunt of Design advocates: if we do not have a probabilistic argument from a detailed model of natural 
processes, we cannot reject Design Intervention.  When evolutionists ask for a similar calculation for the supposed 
Design processes, this is waved away with the argument that we do not understand that Design is not that kind of 
hypothesis.  In bills recently introduced in U.S. legislatures, they want to allow teaching of how Intelligent Design 
explains biological adaptations.  But Design does not have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; such explanation, whatever the legislators think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-we-do-not-have-a-detailed-probabilistic-model-of-evolution&quot;&gt;Why we do not have a detailed probabilistic model of evolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Montañez only requires evolutionary biologists to have a “probabilistic mechanism” stated in sufficient 
detail to actually compute a probability &lt;em&gt;p(x)&lt;/em&gt; that the observed adaptations would occur.  And in addition, able to 
compute the probabilities that adaptations that are as good or better will evolve.  What would we need to know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’d need to know all possible relevant features of the environment, including features of organisms that serve 
as predators, prey, or competitors.  And we’d need to know the entire genetics of our organism, including the functions and interactions of all genes.  And we’d need to know the full developmental biology of all relevant phenotypes, the full physiology, and functional ecology.  That’s all.  Obviously we are nowhere near this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what alternative do Montañez and his friends propose?  Nothing.  Not anything involving any of that biology. The classes in which they would teach their actual theory would be pleasantly short, involving just how to say “Poof!”.
Once that is done, it is time for a relaxing recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functional-information&quot;&gt;Functional Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the distributions that Montañez points to is the one used by people who compute Functional Information.  This is not a creationist-and-or-ID computation, it is an attempt to quantitate how much biological information is 
involved in an adaptation. We start with a uniform distribution over all possible genomes.  If the genome is, say, 
1,000,000 bases long, there would be 4 possibilities at each of those million sites, for a total of 4&lt;sup&gt;1,000,000&lt;/sup&gt; possible sequences.  That’s 10&lt;sup&gt;602060&lt;/sup&gt;, roughly.  We assume that all these are equally probable.  One needs to know what fraction of those achieve 
higher specification, such as higher fitness, than the observed sequence.  Once we know that fraction &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, we can 
compute functional information as &lt;em&gt;-log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P)&lt;/em&gt; bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to take a random one of those sequences and mutate it randomly, you get another random sequence.  If mutation is the only relevant evolutionary process, the distribution of outcomes in the long run is the nearly the same as randomly choosing samples from all possibilities.  If we see in the real organism a reasonble 
fitness, it would have an implausibly high functional information.  Applying 
Montañez’s formulas we would reject random sampling from all sequences as the source of the observed sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-p-hacking-comes-in&quot;&gt;Where P-hacking comes in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some other, biologically plausible, process that could have produced the 
observed sequence?  There is, of course – natural selection.  Instead of meandering mutationally generation after generation, P-hacking occurs.  Among the sequences available, the ones that have higher functionality (in this case, higher fitness) are more likely to be chosen.  If you did this, your teacher would be upset, because the result would be cheating on the exam.  But natural selection does this, not just in each generation, but repeatedly.  And the results accumulate.  Cumulative selection occurs, simply because each generation is the offspring of the previous one.  No elaborate scheme is needed: organisms of higher fitness contribute more genes to the next generation, and future organisms are descended from those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montañez’s paper he says about the equiprobable distribution used in computing Functional Information that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Claiming that a probabilistic process boosts the 
likelihood of observing some particular result 
remains without force unless one can provide some 
actual numbers for this claim, namely, what 
&lt;em&gt;p(x)&lt;/em&gt; is under the proposed distribution (or some 
reasonable lower bound).  Thus the burden of 
providing such estimates resides with those 
proposing the probabilistic process as an 
explanation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the observed fitness of organisms is far higher than it would be for genomes typed on 
four-key typewriters by monkeys, Montañez implies that we cannot simply invoke 
cumulative natural selection.  We’ve got to supply a detailed probabilistic model. 
Otherwise he will invoke Design Intervention.  Which always results in a probability 
of 1 for whatever we see.  And that is the biggest P-hack of all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Pigeon Peas, often known by the Filipino Ilocano language word kardis &amp;nbsp; “P hacking” is a form of cheating, whether inadvertent or advertent.
