<figcaption>BOX SCOUT/No. 2/<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Seneca"> SENECA CAMERA MANUFACTURING COMPANY</a>/Rochester New York USA. The camera has what looks like a landscape lens and precisely 2 shutter speeds: 1/30&nbsp;s or thereabouts, and time. It uses Kodak 120 roll film with a 2-1/4 by 3-1/4&nbsp;in format. Roll film, for the uninitiated, is a layer of film and a layer of paper wrapped around a cylinder of wood or metal. The layer of paper is still in the camera and advises the user to use Kodak Velox paper "for quality." According to a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/787758589/vintage-camera-seneca-scout-2a-box"> not necessarily reliable source</a>, model 2A was manufactured between 1913 and 1920. The 2A, to my surprise, had an <a href="https://www.pacificrimcamera.com/rl/02396/02396.pdf">achromatic lens</a>. I do not know when the model 2 was manufactured.</figcaption>

The 15th annual Panda's Thumb Photography Contest begins now, Monday, June 19, at 12:00 p.m., MDT (MDT = UTC(GMT) – 6 h). Entries will be accepted between now and Friday, July 7, at 12:00 p.m., MDT. The rules are precisely the same as previous years', except, obviously, that the dates have been updated.

We encourage entries in a single, general category, which includes pictures of just about anything of scientific interest: any object of experimentation or observation, from single-celled organisms, through nematodes, fruit flies, rats, chimpanzees, and college sophomores to volcanoes, stars, and galaxies. In order not to omit theoreticians, we will consider computer-generated pictures and also photographs of equipment. Photomicrographs and electron micrographs are likewise welcomed.

Since rumor has it that the pandemic encouraged macro photography, we may, if we receive enough entries, establish a "macro" category.

The winner and the runner-up will receive a copy of Neil Shubin, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540510/some-assembly-required-by-neil-shubin/">Some Assembly Required</a>, a copy of Dan Levitt, 
<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/whats-gotten-into-you-dan-levitt?variant=40390219202594/"> What's Gotten Into You?</a>, generously donated by the <a href="https://ncse.com/">National Center for Science Education</a>, or a copy of one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Matt-Young/author/B001HPILDU/">my own books</a>.

If we get enough entries, consistently with Rules 11 and 12, we may add categories and award additional prizes, presuming, of course, that we can find more prizes.

The rules of the contest are simple:

<ol><li>We will consider any photograph that displays scientific interest – biological, paleontological, geological, or astronomical, for example.</li>

<li>Submit photographs in JPEG format. </li>

<li>Reduce photographs to an information content of 600 pixels horizontally. If creationists require a definition of information, they may apply in writing to the management. </li>

<li>Photographs may be enhanced but may not be montages. High dynamic range photographs and focus-stacked photographs are, however, accepted. </li>

<li>Submit a maximum of 3 photographs (or 5 photographs per family) to <strike>thousandwords@pandasthumb.org</strike> ProfessorSteveSteve@gmail.com. </li>

<li>Submit the photographs as attachments to an e-mail (not embedded in the body of the e-mail). The subject line to the e-mail must have the form YourLastName_PhotographyContest. The filenames for the photographs must have the form YourLastName_Descriptor as, for example, Young_Oxytropis_sericea or Young_Table_Mountain, as appropriate. </li>

<li>In your e-mail, identify the subject of the photograph: common and biological name, mineral type, or geological formation, for example. Provide a link that will allow a reader to learn more about the subject. You may add descriptive text in the body of the e-mail if you like. </li>

<li>Depending on the number of photographs submitted, we may post the best submissions and ask our readers to vote for the best photograph. Likewise, we may establish several categories with separate entries and separate ballots. In particular, students 16 and under should so identify themselves; if we receive enough entries, we will establish a student category. </li>

<li>By submitting a photograph, you stipulate that you are the owner of the copyright and grant The Panda’s Thumb a nonexclusive license to publish the photograph on its blog. The photograph will be subject to a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives license. </li>

<li>Regular contributors to The Panda’s Thumb are not eligible to enter the contest. </li>

<li>The decision of the judges is irrevocable. The judges remain irrepressibly and irreducibly irascible, irreverent, and irredeemable, irregardless and irrespective, but not, we hope, irrational or irritable. We hope for a veritable irruption of entries this year. </li>

<li>Even though we are getting fairly good at running contests, we reserve the right to change any of the rules, or add or subtract rules at any time at our discretion. </li></ol>

We will choose a number of finalists and open voting for the winner at 12:00 p.m. MDT, Monday, July 10. Voting will end Friday, July 21, at 12:00 noon, and the winner will be announced on Monday, July 24, at 12:00.
