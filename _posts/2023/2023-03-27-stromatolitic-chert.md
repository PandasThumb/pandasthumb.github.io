<figcaption>Digitate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite">stromatolites</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunflint_chert">Gunflint formation</a> (Lower Algal Member), Nolalu, Ontario. Mr. Kocher writes, "Specimen is a vertical section cut on lapidary saw (i.e., perpendicular to bedding). Thin piece (1-2 mm thick) is translucent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert">chert</a> and shows preserved columnar algal colonies, hematite oolites, and algal pellets (peloids). Specimen is ~4 cm wide. Variously classified as <i>Collenia undosa</i>, <i>Stratifera biwabikensis</i>, among others. Age ~ 1.8 Ga; Mesoproterozoic." Mr. Kocher explains further, "'Lower Algal Member' is a designation given to a subset of strata within the Gunflint Formation. The Gunflint Formation has been divided up stratigraphically into at least 5 subsets of strata, i.e., 'Members.'" Perhaps it goes without saying, but the specimen is flat, despite the illusion of hills and valleys.
