I have been reading the 2nd edition of <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em> and wanted 
to give some reactions to it, having reached the end of the chapter on "Specified 
Complexity".  This new edition adds Winston Ewert as the second author.  Unlike the 
1998 first edition, which was published by Cambridge University Press, this "Revised 
and Expanded" edition is published by Discovery Institute Press.  It is available 
rather inexpensively, for a book of 582 pages, in a paperback edition and in a 
Kindle edition.  (Its cover illustration shows the faces on Mount Rushmore, as an 
example of a design inference).

William Dembski's original Design Inference argument involved our seeing a 
pattern in nature, in an organism, that embodied what he called Specified 
complexity.  Its argument became better known as a result of Dembski's 2002 
book <em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot be Purchased Without Intelligence".</em> 
This got attention at the time of the Kitzmiller vs. Dover School Board trial in 
2005.


Improbable on a scale (what?)
Improbable that one that good would occur even once in the history of the universea
What is scale of "goodness"?  Adaptation? Fitness?
Something that evolution achieves?

Functional Information
   Orgel "specified information"
   Szostak 2003 Nature
   Hazen, Carothers, Griffin, and Szostak 2007 PNAS
   ID guy too 2008 or so
  Argued that CSI is like FI (who?)
  

Sketch of the 2002 argument
   What were given as examples in the 1996 book, in the 2002 book
   Clarificiation (or change) of the argument in 2005-2006

   (Answers: Elsberry and Shallit 2003ff.  Elsberry and Wilkins 2002
    Me in 2007)




The new argument (ASC)
   ASC = CSI =  length - program length
   "chance" defined as everything else beside design
   no notion of "goodness = degree of adaptation"
   An example of CSI by natural causes: phyllotaxis (auxins)

How is Dembski going to use this to refute the improvement of 
adaptation by natural evolutionary processes?

Thanks to Shallit, English, Matzke, Young (all their fault!)
