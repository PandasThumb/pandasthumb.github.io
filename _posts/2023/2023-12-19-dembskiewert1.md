I have been reading the 2nd edition of <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em> and wanted 
to give some reactions to it, having reached the end of the chapter on "Specified 
Complexity".  This new edition adds Winston Ewert as the second author.  Unlike the 
1998 first edition, which was published by Cambridge University Press, this "Revised 
and Expanded" edition is published by Discovery Institute Press.  It is available 
rather inexpensively, for a book of 582 pages, in a paperback edition and in a 
Kindle edition.  (Its cover illustration shows the faces on Mount Rushmore, as an 
example of a design inference).

William Dembski's original Design Inference argument involved our seeing a 
pattern in nature, in an organism, that embodied what he called Specified 
complexity.  Its argument became better known as a result of Dembski's 2002 
book <em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot be Purchased Without Intelligence".</em> 
This was much invoked at the time of the Kitzmiller vs. Dover School Board trial in 
2005.


Improbable on a scale (what?)
Improbable that one that good would occur even once in the history of the universea
What is scale of "goodness"?  Adaptation? Fitness?
Something that evolution achieves?

A unique signature of intelligence

Design detection is firmly entrenched in science, including forensic science, defence research, SETI, archeology, and biology. In each area, a variety of methods are used, but the core aspect of all of them can be quantified in terms of functional information (defined in the literature by Szostak (1), Hazen et al., (2), and Durston et al. (3)). In layperson’s terms, functional information is the information required to produce a desired effect. A testable, verifiable, and falsifiable hypothesis that is highly useful to design detection can be stated as follows:

Hypothesis: A unique property of intelligent minds is the ability to produce statistically significant levels of functional information as defined in the literature.

A key word here is “unique”; intelligence is the only thing with enough intellectual horsepower to produce significant levels of functional information. The above hypothesis is certainly testable and falsifiable. To falsify it, all we need is to verify a natural, mindless process that will produce statistically significant levels of functional information. 
... the only option science has on the table that is observable, testable, and verified is intelligence
Almost anything, including dumping alphabet characters out of a box on to the floor, can produce functional information at trivial or non-significant levels. However, if one wishes to produce significant levels of functional information one needs something else in addition. Right now, the only option science has on the table that is observable, testable, and verified is intelligence. Although there are other creative scenarios as to how large quantities of functional information can be formed naturally, our failure to verify them suggests that they should be more properly classified as science fiction. (4)

A scientific method for Design Detection

The hypothesis stated above provides the basis for a scientific method to test any effect to see if it required intelligence to produce.

Step One: Evaluate the level of functional information required to produce the effect

Step Two: Determine if the level of functional information is statistically significant

Step Three: If it is statistically significant, then we can infer that intelligence was required to produce the effect

Is this a “god-of-the-gaps” argument?

Oddly, I have people confidently assert that I have presented a “god-of-the-gaps” argument, which clearly it is not. A “god-of-the-gaps” argument always contains the following premise, either explicit or assumed …

“god-of-the-gaps” premise: If we don’t know what produced “X”, then God did it.

The scientific method I presented above is obviously devoid of such a premise. We actually know what can produce functional information—intelligence. It is an observable fact. We do it all the time whenever we send a text, write an essay, or build something. It is the only empirically verified option that science has today; other scenarios still remain in the category of unverified science fiction. Functional information is a positive indicator or ‘fingerprint’ of an intelligent mind.

2nd PDZ Domain by Kirk Durston using MacPyMol
2nd PDZ Domain by Kirk Durston using MacPyMol

My first step was to develop and publish a method to estimate the level of functional information required to code for protein families—an essential requirement for life. (3) Applying that method to a multiple sequence alignment consisting of 30,176 sequences for the second PDZ domain (5) reveals that this protein domain requires at least 140 bits of functional information. To understand how significant that is, the probability that natural processes could generate that level of functional information is 1 chance in 10 with 41 zeros after it. Recent work by other scientists on the PDZ domain indicates that my method is quite conservative, but a conservative estimate is more preferable than an overestimate, since I wish to avoid false positives (having the digital information for a protein test positive for intelligent design when it might not be the case).  

Implications

The above example was for a protein domain only one third the length of an average protein. Using that result as a ballpark estimate, an average protein-coding gene will require very roughly 420 bits of functional information and even the simplest bacteria require hundreds of different genes.

Conclusion: 

The positive markers (fingerprints) of an intelligent mind are all over the genomes of life. Life tests positive for intelligent design utilizing the scientific method outlined above. We can conclude, therefore, that the fingerprints of intelligence are all over the DNA of life.

Additional Reading:

For a fascinating summary of how well science is doing in attempting to answer the origin of life question, I recommend this brief article by James Tour, internationally distinguished synthetic organic chemist, ‘Time Out’.

For an excellent book relating to this subject, read Stephen C. Meyer’s, Darwin’s Doubt.

Darwin Devolves, by Michael J. Behe.

Sketch of the 2002 argument
   What were given as examples in the 1996 book, in the 2002 book
   Clarificiation (or change) of the argument in 2005-2006

The new argument (ASC)
   ASC = CSI =  length - program length
   "chance" defined as everything else beside design
   no notion of "goodness = degree of adaptation"
   An example of CSI by natural causes: phyllotaxis (auxins)

How is Dembski going to use this to refute the improvement of 
adaptation by natural evolutionary processes?
