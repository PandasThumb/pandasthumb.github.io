I have been reading the 2nd edition of <em>The Design Inference</em> and wanted 
to give some reactions to it, having reached the end of the chapter on "Specified 
Complexity".  This new edition adds Winston Ewert as the second author.  Unlike the 
1996 first edition, which was published by Cambridge University Press, this "Revised 
and Expanded" edition is published by Discovery Institute Press.  It is available 
rather inexpensively, for a book of 582 pages, in a paperback edition and in a 
Kindle edition.  (Its cover illustration shows the faces on Mount Rushmore, as an 
example of a design inference).

William Dembski's original Design Inference argument involved our seeing a 
pattern in nature, in an organism, that embodied what he called Specified 
complexity.
