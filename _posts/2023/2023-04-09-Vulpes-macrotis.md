<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_fox"><i>Vulpes macrotis</i></a> &ndash; kit fox. Mr. Rice writes, "This kit fox was photographed shortly after sunset along a dirt track in central Nevada.  Kit foxes are the smallest North American fox, and favor arid climates. I've had a couple of wonderful encounters with kit foxes, and they seem to be far more curious than afraid; however, it is likely that in the places I've seen them, they've never encountered a human before." He notes that they are about half the size of a coyote.
