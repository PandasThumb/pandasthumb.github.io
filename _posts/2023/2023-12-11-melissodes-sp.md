<figcaption><a href="https://echinaceaproject.org/field-guides/bee/apidae/melissodes-2/"><i>Melissodes</i> sp.</a> &ndash; long-horned bee. Oh dear, this is embarrassing (not that anything truly embarrasses us any more): It looks like we must have had a computer crash in 2020, when this picture was submitted, and we do not know who the photographer was, except that their surname is Lubin. If that photographer is still lurking, perhaps they can supply their full name and any comment they might want to add.
