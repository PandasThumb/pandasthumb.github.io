Our colleague Nathan Lents has just posted a series of videos, <a href="https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2023/09/09/some-interviews-on-our-poorly-designed-bodies/">Some interviews on our poorly designed bodies</a>. Lents, a biology professor at John Jay College, is the author of the book <a href="https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/book-human-errors/">Human Errors</a> and is an expert on poor design. So far, I have watched only the video on "Why the Human Eye Is a Design Disaster" and noted the comparison with the cephalopod eye. All I can add is that, in addition, cephalopods cannot get dry eyes.
