In a brisk hour and a quarter or so,

<blockquote>"Ross talks with Dan Phelps, president of the Kentucky Paleontological Society and persistent thorn in the side of creationist Ken Ham. Learn why Answers in Genesis only paid $1 for 98 acres of land and how their parking lot pays for the corporate jet."</blockquote>

And more!
