&nbsp;

The ID-advocacy blog Uncommon Descent is dead (or maybe undead).  The blog was founded by 
William Dembski in April, 2005, the year of the Dover School Board case.  It became a central 
site for posts arguing for Intelligent Design, with the comment sections having arguments 
back and forth.  Many of the posts were by the ever-astonishing Denyse O'Leary, who took on this job, writing as "News".

In 2008 Dembski withdrew from active participation in the site; its administration was
set up as a nonprofit organization. The Denver-area right-wing lawyer Barry Arrington 
took over administration of the site, ruling with an iron hand.

In the last few weeks UD had frequently been down.  This seems to be connected to what finally happened on April 12.  William Dembski posted an announcement that the site had been "archived" by the 
Discovery Institute and would be available in that form.  The front page layout changed, 
with links to posts and their comments but no way for anyone to post further comments.  Dembski's post was a farewell to the site, in which he gave an account of its history and thanked 
the people who helped with it.  No further posts are expected to appear. 
The blog had died, and was only available in that form.  

Or was it?

## Afterglow ##

For a few days after, one could access a version of UD that was in its original form, and 
did not include Dembski's farewell post.  Commenters continued to argue in the threads 
for recent posts, but these comments were not included in the archived versions.  No new 
posts appeared on that undead form.  I am told that there were two links in the DNS record 
for UD, corresponding to different forms of the URL.

But the undead version had not long to go.  It seems now to have vanished, and its recent 
comments with it.

##My favorite moments##

There are many fond memories I have of UD.  I'll just mention two (you are encouraged to 
tell us yours, in the comments below).

### Indefensible ###

The first was a post by the late, lamented Gil Dodgen [(here)](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-some-point-the-obvious-becomes-transparently-obvious-or-recognizing-the-forrest-with-alls-its-barbs-through-the-trees/) in 2011.  Forgetting the main meaning of the word "indefensible", he declared that

> At UD we have many brilliant ID apologists, and they continue to mount what I perceive as increasingly indefensible assaults on the creative powers of the Darwinian mechanism of random errors filtered by natural selection.

(I think he meant by "indefensible" that no one could mount a defense against the "assaults").  Anyway, I [rushed to agree](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/06/total-agreement.html) here at PT.

### The Great Purge of 2012 ###

My second favorite UD moment was Barry Arrington carrying out [the Great Purge of 2012](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/why-is-barry-arringtonstifling-dissent-at-ud/).  Obviously 
irritated by having so many cogent opponents of ID in the comment section, he declared that 

> The issue, then, is not whether persons who disagree with us on the facts and logic will be allowed to debate on this site. Anyone who disagrees about the facts and logic is free to come here at any time. But if you come on here and say, essentially, that facts and logic do not matter, then we have no use for you.

He declared that commenters were denying basic logical principles such as the Law of Non-Contradiction.

> For that reason, I am today announcing a new moderation policy at UD. At any time the moderator reserves the right to ask the following question to any person who would comment or continue to comment on this site: “Can the moon exist and not exist at the same time and in the same formal relation?” The answer to this question is either “yes” or “no.” If the person gives any answer other than the single word “no,” he or she will immediately be deemed not worth arguing with and therefore banned from this site.

Of course lots of people thought immediately of the results of quantum mechanics, in which 
an object is actually a wave, and not necessarily located in one precise place.  They said "Well, 
actually, ..." and were immediately banned.  Pro-evolution commenters were banned almost 
en masse.  Even some creationist commenters reacted that way ... and they were banned too.

One of the most patient, temperate, polite, incisive, and logical pro-evolution commenters at UD was 
Elizabeth Liddle, a neuroscientist at the University of Nottingham in England.  She 
immediately made available her own blog [The Skeptical Zone](https://thesketicalzone.org) as 
a home for discussion by the banned and the unbanned.

I later made a post about this hilarious purge (in 2015 [at The Skeptical Zone](http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/was-denial-of-the-laws-of-thought-a-myth/)) asking whether 
anyone could actually point out any comments at UD where pro-evolution commenters rejected laws of logic.  No 
one could.

Arrington must have realized that without any pro-evolution commentators the site would 
die of lack of interest, because he allowed some to remain after that, without 
getting too insistent on the existence of the moon.


## Failures to stay on-topic ##

I wish I could say that most of the discussion at UD was about evolution 
and ID.  But the pro-ID and/or creationist participants seemed to feel 
that the basic issue was the existence of God, and their basic task was 
to refute atheism.  So much space was devoted to where the Universe 
came from, whether the laws of physics were fine-tuned for life, and 
whether there was any basis for morality if there was not a God.

The result was an awful lot of off-topic posts and comments.  If the 
Universe is the result of fine-tuned laws, that makes it easier, 
not harder, to imagine that biological evolution occurred.  And the 
origin of the Universe or of morality has basically nothing to do 
with whether evolution occurred or whether Design Intervention must 
have occurred.

## The Big Tent ##

The Intelligent Design movement tries to maintain a "big tent", 
and make its arguments attractive to people who reject 
Young-Earth Creationism.  They are offended by the thought that 
people think that they are YECs.  But at the same time they 
needed the political and financial backing of YEC folks. This 
creates dilemmas for them.

In fact, many of the most active commenters at UD seemed to 
be YECs. This led to some commenters arguing that there 
was overwhelming evidence against "evolution", while others 
were angry at us for even suggesting that ID advocates 
rejected evolution.  These folks never seemed to notice one 
another, let alone debate each other.  So much for deep thinking 
about evolutionary theory.

## What were your favorite moments? ##

But enough from me.  For those who paid attention to UD, what were 
your favorite moments?
