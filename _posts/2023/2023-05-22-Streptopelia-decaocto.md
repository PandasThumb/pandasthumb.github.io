<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Eurasian_Collared-Dove/overview"><i>Streptopelia decaocto</i></a> &ndash; Eurasian collared dove, Elmer's Two-Mile Creek, Boulder, Colorado, 27 April 2023. It seemed kind of late in the season, but these doves were acting kind of, well, lovey-dovey, so I pruriently snapped their picture. The collared doves have colonized the city, and (as I have noted earlier) I no longer see nor hear mourning doves, <i>Zenaida macroura</i>, within the city limits.
