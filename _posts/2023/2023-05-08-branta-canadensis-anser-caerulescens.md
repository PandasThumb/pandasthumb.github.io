<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_goose"><i>Branta canadensis</i></a> &ndash; Canada goose &ndash; being shadowed by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goose"><i>Anser caerulescens</i></a> &ndash; snow goose &ndash; Coot Lake, Boulder, Colorado, April, 2023. The lone snow goose followed a meter or two behind the Canada goose the entire time we watched. Since the two species are known to <a href="https://ebird.org/species/x00197">hybridize</a>, I wondered whether they were a pair.
