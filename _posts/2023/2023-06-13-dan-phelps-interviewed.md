Dan Phelps was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1d-DG0N1LU"> interviewed at length</a> on a program called Captive Desk by David Murray about his opposition to the Ark Park and other Answers in Genesis shenanigans. The interview lasted nearly an hour and a half, and covered geology, paleontology, and pseudoscience, in addition to AIG. As Mr. Murray details in his introduction, Mr. Phelps has had a remarkably productive career, aside from his day job. Watch the interview!
