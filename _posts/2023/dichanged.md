Jerry Coyne has published a [post at his blog](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/07/23/has-the-discovery-institute-changed-its-mission/), Why Evolution Is True asking "Has the Discovery Institute changed its mission?"   After a review of the DI's mission 
statements, the goals in its 1998 Wedge Document, and information on its funding, he notes that they are still well-funded and active.  Nowadays the activity is making human-exceptionalist arguments about AI, and highlighting "problems of evolution".

Previous campaigns to "teach the controversy" and introduce ID into the classroom were rejected by the courts, culminating in the 
famous Dover School Board case of 2005.  Here is Jerry's summary:

<blockquote>This is where creationism in America has gotten to. It started with mandating Biblical creationism in schools, and when that was rejected they tried to get “scientific creationism” taught, but that failed, too, as it was just Biblical creationism gussied up in scientific language. Then it became the “teach the alternatives” (evolution/Biblical creationism), which was declared unconstitutional since the Biblical alternative was just religion pushed into the public schools. Then the strategy became “teach intelligent design (which isn’t creationism),” something that federal judge John Jones deep-sixed in the Kitzmiller case. Now the pathetic institute is reduced to just pointing out problems with evolution, but nobody’s adopting that strategy either.</blockquote>

I wonder whether this isn't too reassuring.  Here's why ...

## Their AI initiative ##

First, an aside on their AI initiative.  This is concentrated in the relatively new Walter Bradley Center of Natural and Artificial Intelligence.  It seeks to present mathematical arguments that artificial intelligence will never be able to achieve true natural intelligence.  This is a human-exceptionalism argument, which implicitly works against human intelligence having evolved by 
unintelligent processes.  But I can't see how it plays out in the public sphere.  (I suppose that judging whether true natural intelligence has been achieved is to be done by a panel of True Scotsmen).
  
## Is it all over? ##

With the 2005 Jones decision in the Dover case, there seemed to be no chance that courts would allow the Religious Right to 
teach creationism, even in its ID guise.  The precedents were all clear: _Epperson v. Arkansas (1968)_, _Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971)_, _McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education (1982)_, _Edwards v. Aguillard (1987)_, and finally _Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board (2005)_.  These rulings presented a huge legal barrier for introducing creationist and ID arguments into schools.  It was settled 
precedent, as well established as, well, say _Roe v. Wade_.

And there lies the problem. With a right-wing supermajority on the Supreme Court, and with the Federalist Society shepherding 
hundreds of right-wing federal judges into the lower courts, there is now no guarantee that any of these precedents will be 
effective.  (And yes, I'm aware that _Kitzmiller_ is not formally precedent at the national level).  It's not paranoia to 
foresee that

* State legislators will continue to introduce bills allowing 
teachers to introduce creationist and ID material into their 
classes
* and bills demanding equal time for this material
* and bills mandating discussion of "problems of evolution"
* Local teachers and their school boards will feel uninhibited in 
violating separation of church and state
* Governors and legislatures in Red states will delight in pushing measures 
that reward the Religious Right.
* Appeals against these in the courts will fare badly, and no 
one will be able to foresee success at the Supreme Court.

## Low expectations ##

It's true that right now (or perhaps I should say "Right now") wars over 
evolution are not very visible.  The Right in general, and the Religious 
Right in particular, are concentrating on demonizing transgender 
people and LGTBQ+ rights more generally.

But alongside desperate struggles to defend democracy and human rights more 
generally, we will see gradually increasing efforts to attack 
the teaching of evolutionary biology at all levels.  Waiting for the 
courts to do the right thing will only end with them doing 
the Right thing.

We are in for a long period of war in the trenches, including 
struggles to provide good and accessible resources for studying 
and teaching evolutionary biology, not just for biology 
students but for interested folks in general.

# Optimism #

In the longer run I'm hopeful, because I think that many 
students will understand that this struggle is going on, and 
where the attacks on evolution are coming from.  And most young 
people won't buy them.

Any thoughts?
