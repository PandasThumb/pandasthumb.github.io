The ID advocacy site <em>Evolution News</em> has had a series of posts by the physicist 
Eric Hedin.  The theme has been that adaptive information in biological organisms info
cannot have been produced by natural processes, because these always degrade information. 
Hedin is a well-trained physicist.  He is currently the Professor of Physics and Astronomy 
and the Chair of the Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering at Biola University, 
and he trained in plasma physics at my own university.

With that strong background in physics, we should be able to rely on his statements about 
the increase of the amount of biological information which is possible 
owing to ordinary physical and biological processes.  Here's what his says 
at one point in [this recent post at Evolution News](https://evolutionnews.org/2023/05/is-life-an-information-ratchet/)):

> Could a natural information ratchet exist? Since our goal is to understand whether life is an information ratchet, we first need to examine what kind of mechanism might be required to cause a living system to ratchet up its information content over time. To increase information means to select outcomes that correspond to a greater level of functional or meaningful complexity. The only way for this to happen is if the selection mechanism (in other words, the ratchet) is designed to produce the target outcome, and this means that the mechanism must already contain the information specifying the target. A physical mechanism cannot produce any information beyond what it already contains. 

I have complained [in a previous post](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/22/09/badinformation.html) about 
his statements about conservation of information and about there being no 
natural process that can account for the information accumulated in 
living things.  Here it is again.

Can it be that Professor Hedin has got his basic science wrong?  Say it ain't so!

Well, it ain't so in one case.   If we have a population that consists of 
only one individual, and that individual reproduces exclusively clonally, by budding off 
a single offspring identical to itself, then Hedin is right.  There is never
any other individual in the population than that offspring, and no opportunity 
for natural selection to act.  If a mutation occurs, the altered genotype is 
immediately 100% of the population.

## Mutation accumulation lines ##

Geneticists actually use such situations as an experimental design, when 
they want to see as many as possible of the mutations that occur, both 
advantageous and deleterious.  These one-individual populations are 
called "mutation accumulation lines".  Of course many species cannot 
reproduce with only one parent, and cannot reproduce by budding.  The 
closest we can come to a clone in, say, mice, is to have a population 
of two individuals, who are brother and sister, and mate those every
generation.  But that allows natural selection to occur for one or 
two generations for the average mutation.  So the spectrum of mutations 
accumulated in the population is partly biased against deleterious 
mutants.  Which suggests that in all cases other than a clonally-reproducing 
population of one single individual, there will be some natural 
selection occurring.

## Why Professor Hedin gets it wrong ##

So when there is, not a single individual, but a population of 
individuals, then Eric Hedin's analysis has to ask what the effect 
of natural selection is, not just what the effect of accumulated 
mutation is.  He sounds as if he is only taking mutation into account.

In his next paragraph, he deals with natural selection:

> Darwin's Proposed "Ratchet"
>
> What about Darwin's proposed "ratchet" mechanism of natural selection based on survival of the fittest? The mechanism invoked here already contains a high degree of functional complexity (all the complexity residing in a living organism). But what can this "ratchet" do? No more than it was designed to do â€” namely to reproduce daughter organisms according to its inherent mechanism of reproduction. Variations in the organism's genome, by any unguided process, may lead to an increase in fitness and therefore survivability. But natural processes cannot produce unnatural results. Selection based on the ratchet mechanism of increased fitness cannot of itself produce novel complex functionality if each successive small change does not give some increased advantage towards survival and reproduction. 

(We should note that Darwin never used the word "ratchet".  Daniel Dennett did, in his writings on natural selection.)

Dr. Hedin returns to the role of natural selection in the paragraph following that in his 
post:

> The allure of Darwinism is that it suggests a process by which a population of organisms can ratchet up information and increase organismal functionality. A common misunderstanding of evolution is to assume that it can do more than steadily lock in natural variations that increase survivability. The error is in ascribing to this process the ability to ratchet up the information content of a simple common ancestor until all the complex, functionally coherent species of life on Earth have formed. But as shown in our examination of the functionality of any ratchet mechanism, it cannot produce an outcome beyond what it was designed to achieve. With information as the outcome, the mechanism can only reproduce the level of information it already contains. 

## Does Hedin think natural selection _can_ increase information? ##

Now, this is puzzling.  In the preceding paragraph it was clearly stated that natural processes could not add meaningful biological information to the organism, unless the process already contains the information.  That seems to say that natural processes, including natural selection, cannot possibly increase the specified (adaptive) information.  The natural processes can at best transfer information that they already have.

But he _does_ acknowledge that natural selection in a population _can_ "steadily lock in natural variations that increase survivability".  That would involve increasing the specified information in the population.  This would seem to completely contradict his own earlier statements. He says that "selection based on the ratchet mechanism of 
increased fitness cannot of itself produce novel complex functionality if each successive small change does not give some increased advantage towards survival and reproduction". The later statements say, in effect, that actually natural selection <em>can</em> increase the content of 
adaptive (specified) information.  The implication is that selection _can_ produce increased 
information content in the genome if each small change on the way _does_ give some 
increase in fitness.  The previous impossibility has turned into a possibility.  It is just that natural selection and mutation (and other 
ordinary evolutionary processes) cannot produce "unnatural" results, really big increases in "complexity".  Hedin continues:


> Another Process at Work
> 
> Given the obvious, that the complexity of organisms on Earth has increased through time from single-cell archaea to functional multicellular creatures, some process other than a supposed evolutionary information ratchet must have been at work. The genomic information content of the prokaryotic cells descriptive of the earliest life on Earth falls far short of the greater information content and complexity of advanced life. An intelligent mind is the only known source for the necessary input of complex specified information throughout biological history. 



## Hedin's actual conclusions ##

So Professor Hedin has argued, in effect, that:

1. Natural evolutionary processes cannot increase the adaptive 
information of a population of organisms, because there is a 
conservation law preventing that.
2. ... except that they _can_ increase the adaptive 
information in the population, they just cannot increase 
it to an "unnatural" extent.
3. And it is his (unsupported) opionion that the increases 
of "complexity" in living things involve those kinds of 
"unnatural" increases.
4. ... and therefore those require Design Intervention.

A promised conservation law that prevents information from being increased by natural selection is described.  Then it evaporates and is 
replaced by Professor Hedin's personal incredulity.

I would add that the information in the genome does not come from 
nowhere -- the process of natural selection is part of the flow 
of energy through the biosphere, and is accompanied by an 
increase of entropy in the whole system, with adaptation 
capturing energy and slowing the increase of entropy.


## Your opinion? ##

Have I got this wrong?  I hope that someone, perhaps Dr. 
Hedin himself, will let us know.
