<figcaption>This ferocious looking creature may resemble an Asian lady beetle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonia_axyridis"><i>Harmonia axyridis</i></a>, eating an aphid, but it is in fact an Internet Avenger eating a troll. They will be out in force tomorrow night, October 31, the eve of All Hallows Day. Trolls are hereby warned not to go online tomorrow and at all costs stay away from bridges.
