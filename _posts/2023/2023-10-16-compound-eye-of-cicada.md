<figcaption>Unidentified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada">cicada</a>. This remarkable photograph is a raindrop on the compound eye of a cicada. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "I was unable to identify this cicada because its colors hadn't developed yet; I had just photographed its molt into its final instar, the flying adult form, just before the rains came. Once they'd stopped, I noticed the lensing effect of the raindrop on the compound eye and went in as close as possible to capture those facets. The entire compound eye is about 2&nbsp;mm in width."</figcaption>
