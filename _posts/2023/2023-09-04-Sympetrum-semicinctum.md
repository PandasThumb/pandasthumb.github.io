<p>I saw these dragonflies on the trail in the vicinity of Wonderland Lake, just begging to be photographed. The picture above is the band-winged meadowhawk, as demonstrated by the brown bands on the wings. When I examined the photographs, I found that not all meadowhawks are alike. Below the fold a dragonfly that to my eye looks identical, except that its wings do not display the brown, translucent bands.</p>
