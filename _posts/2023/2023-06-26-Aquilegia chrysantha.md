<figcaption><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/beauty/columbines/aquilegia_chrysantha.shtml"><i>Aquilegia chrysantha</i></a> &ndash; golden columbine. A week or so ago, I was, as Feynman might say, <a href="https://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/isc3523c/feyn_surely.pdf">observing the gorgeous garden</a> of my friend Ron Wittmann (coauthor of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Colorado-Flora-Eastern-Fourth-Vascular/dp/1607321408">Colorado Flora: Eastern Slope, Fourth Edition: A Field Guide to the Vascular Plants</a>, as well as a companion to the western slope). It was raining and fairly nasty, but I managed this snapshot. It is not the Colorado state flower; that is the blue columbine, <i>A. caerulea</i>. I have a picture of that too, but unfortunately it lacks the raindrops.</figcaption>
