This month's carnival is typically diverse in its topics and contributors, and is typically excellent. Watch for cuckoos and other parasites, learn about flapping before wings, explore historical concepts like uniformitarianism, and read about the origins of the human hand. Eyes, nurseryfish, trade-offs, Barbara McClintock. And the suggestion that "evolutionary biology needs better PR."

Head over to [The Mermaid's Tale](http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2011/11/carnival-of-evolution-41.html) and sample the bounty.
