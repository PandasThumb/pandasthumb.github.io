<big>Rayleigh scattering at [sunset](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/sunset/), near Ravenfield, UK.</big> The sun is near the horizon, and its rays travel a long distance through the atmosphere, which filters blue light as a result of Rayleigh scattering. The clouds are therefore illuminated by red light and appear red. In this picture the sun is somewhat overexposed and incorrectly appears yellow.
