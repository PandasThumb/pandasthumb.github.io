I"É<p>If you scroll to the bottom of the front page of Pandaâ€™s Thumb, you will see that we have implemented a new feature,
a list of the 8 most recent comments.  (We can make that number bigger if needed).  This should make it much easier for you
find the new comments on PT posts, without need to scroll through all subthreads of comments or to have a email notifications
mailed to you.</p>

<p>We hope to have more improvements soon.  The highest priority among them is restoring all the old comments on earlier posts.
These disappeared when PT moved to Github, but they still exist offline and we hope to find ways to restore them.  Thanks
particularly to our peerless leader Reed for guidance on all this.</p>
