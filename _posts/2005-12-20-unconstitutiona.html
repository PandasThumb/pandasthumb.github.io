<p>The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10545387/">judge in Dover strikes down ID</a>. It's a solid and scathing judgment that declares teaching Intelligent Design in the schools is unconstitutional. The <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/051220_kitzmiller_342.pdf">decision by Judge Jones is available</a>&mdash;it's joyful reading for us on the side of science. Here are a few excerpts:</p>

<blockquote><p>Plaintiffs accurately submit that the disclaimer mimics the one that the Fifth 
Circuit struck down as unconstitutional in Freiler in two key aspects.  First, while 
encouraging students to keep an open mind and explore alternatives to evolution, it 
offers no scientific alternative; instead, the only alternative offered is an inherently 
religious one, namely, ID.  43 
 Freiler, 185 F.3d at 344-47 (disclaimer urging students 
to "exercise critical thinking and gather all information possible and closely 
examine each alternative toward forming an opinion" referenced "Biblical version 

of Creation" as the only alternative theory, thus "encourag[ing] students to read 
and meditate upon religion in general and the "Biblical version of Creation" in 
particular.)  Whether a student accepts the Board's invitation to explore Pandas, 
and reads a creationist text, or follows the Board's other suggestion and discusses 
"Origins of Life" with family members, that objective student can reasonably infer 
that the District"s favored view is a religious one, and that the District is 
accordingly sponsoring a form of religion.  Second, by directing students to their 
families to learn about the "Origins of Life," the paragraph performs the exact 
same function as did the Freiler disclaimer: It "reminds school children that they 
can rightly maintain beliefs taught by their parents on the subject of the origin of 
life," thereby stifling the critical thinking that the class's study of evolutionary 
theory might otherwise prompt, to protect a religious view from what the Board 
considers to be a threat.  Id. at 345 (because disclaimer effectively told students 
"that evolution as taught in the classroom need not affect what they already know," 
it sent a message that was "contrary to an intent to encourage critical thinking, 
which requires that students approach new concepts with an open mind and 
willingness to alter and shift existing viewpoints").</p></blockquote>


<p>This is the best part to me&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>
To be sure, Darwin's theory of evolution is imperfect.  However, the fact 
that a scientific theory cannot yet render an explanation on every point should not 
be used as a pretext to thrust an untestable alternative hypothesis grounded in 
religion into the science classroom or to misrepresent well-established scientific 
propositions. </p>
<p>The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the 
Board who voted for the ID Policy.  It is ironic that several of these individuals, 
who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would 
time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID 
Policy.</p>
<p>With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID 
have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors.  Nor 
do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed.  As 
stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an 
alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom. </p> 
<p>Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an 
activist judge.  If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. 
Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction 
on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a 
constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an 
imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy.  The breathtaking inanity of the 
Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which 
has now been fully revealed through this trial.  The students, parents, and teachers 
of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal 
maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources.</p></blockquote>
