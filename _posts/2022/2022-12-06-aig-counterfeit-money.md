Ken Ham and his fellow creationist grifters plan to disrupt King Charlesâ€™s Coronation by handing out <a href="https://youtu.be/eIUY2oi20Fc">religious tracts disguised as money</a>.

This is hilarious. They are raising money to print and distribute 3 million counterfeit "1 Million Pound" notes that will display fundamentalist/creationist tracts on the reverse side. They are shamelessly raising money to do this. I wonder if the British Secret Service will also be amused.
