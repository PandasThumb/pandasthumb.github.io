# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 6) #

November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

__Why was this article written?__

As I hope has become clear, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article does not meet the requirements that one has the right to place on a scientific publication. It suggests results that do not exist. The article relies entirely on a statistical method to demonstrate designs that is unusable. It contains references to an indeterminate supernatural designer that resorts to ad hoc to achieve desired results. It introduces the completely revolutionary concept of "non-physical information" without definition or discussion. It contains a grossly garbled quote. In addition, well-known pseudoscientific concepts such as "irreducible complexity" and "specified complexity" are referred to as if they were established science. This cannot be called science. It can only be called pseudoscience.

Of course, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have received criticism. Three biologists write in a comment to the Journal of Theoretical Biology, among other things:

> ... The central claim of this paper is that because biological systems are complex then they must be fine-tuned. This inference is flawed and is not supported by the evidence.

Nor is the mathematician Jason Rosenhaus gracious in his criticism. He concludes thus:

> ... The authors claim to have used probability theory to establish a scientifically rigorous and useful notion of "fine-tuning," but they have failed because we have nothing like the information we would need to carry out meaningful probability calculations. Done.

But I don't think I've adequately communicated just how bad this paper is. The authors are constantly tossing out bits of mathematical jargon and notation, but then they do nothing with them. There is a frustrating lack of precision, as when they variously describe fine-tuning as an object, an entity, a method, and an attribute of a system, all on the first page of the paper. They constantly cite creationist references, with only the most glancing mention that any of this work has been strongly and cogently criticized. They say we should give fair consideration to a "design model" for the origin of complex structures, but they do not give the beginning of a clue as to what such a model entails.

In short, it's hard to believe this paper could have gotten through an honest peer-review process (as opposed to one in which ideology played a big role). Whatever happened behind the scenes, it's a huge black eye for the journal.

The review is worth reading in its entirety. It also covers things I didn't cover here.

<div align="center">***</div>

Steinar Thorvaldsen is professor of informatics at Norway's Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors at reputed universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would write papers of this poor quality in their own subjects (I also doubt they would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk name and reputation to write an article that makes me and many colleagues scratch their foreheads and wonder what has flown into the authors? This is not something you expect from a professor at a respected university.

My guess is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism that characterizes established natural science. The idea of "Intelligent Design" as an alternative, non-materialistic science was launched in the USA in the 1990s by the conservative Christian think tank Discovery Institute. The institute's agenda was revealed in 1999 when the policy document The Wedge Document was leaked and posted on the Internet. It appears that they see "materialism" and moral relativism as the cause of all evil in society. Materialism must therefore be crushed:

> The Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies.

An important part of materialism is today's natural science, and therefore is an overarching goal

> To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.

Design theory has been created to replace materialistic science:

> Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.

The document shows very clearly that the ID project is a political/religious project; it is about working for a society that is completely imbued with a Christian religiosity. A state of God, in other words. Natural science is "materialistic" and therefore stands in the way. Therefore, it must be replaced by a religiously based design science.<sup>1</sup> Now, if any reader should think that I am presenting conspiracy theories, I would like to recommend a careful reading of the document.

This explains why they continue to pursue ID as a science even though the project is completely sterile - in more than 20 years they have not managed to produce a single solid result that concretely demonstrates design in nature. On the other hand, mountains of material have been produced that criticize established natural science in general and the theory of evolution in particular. The goal of the activity is not primarily to convince the researchers, it is to convince the public and decision-makers at various levels that design theory is better science than the established, materialistic, natural science. The document shows that the strategy is to defeat science in the political arena.

But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian foundation BioCosmos, Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as "ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread intelligent design, primarily to youth and young adults, and are Norwegian partners of the Discovery Institute. Their article falls into the same pattern as countless other pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many arguments against the theory of evolution.

Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists, be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific, project.

Whatever the case may be, it is sad that two such competent and meritorious researchers are unable to live up to the scientific integrity one has the right to expect from them.

__Part 6: Why was the fine-tuning article written?__

In part 6, Erkell goes further and asks what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to write the article on fine-tuning. I quote:

"Steinar Thorvaldsen is professor of informatics at Norway's Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors at reputed universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would write papers of this poor quality in their own subjects (I also doubt they would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk name and reputation to write an article that makes me and many colleagues scratch their foreheads and wonder what has flown into the authors? This is not something you expect from a professor at a respected university. My guess is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism that characterizes established natural science.”

I have already in parts 1-5 responded to Erkell's claims that TH2020 is a pseudoscientific article of poor quality. Let me therefore answer Erkell's question why I have been involved in writing this and other articles with an ID-based or creationist focus. There are two main reasons. Firstly, I have belonged to the academic world since I started studying university mathematics at the age of 15. This time has given me an important education in how (empirical) science should be conducted. I advocate academic freedom, where all relevant theories are allowed to participate and compete on equal terms in providing the best explanation for the data, in the search for truth. For more than 20 years, I have studied genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that Darwin's theory of evolution contains crucial flaws that are rarely mentioned, neither in school nor in university. It is my duty as a scientist (part of the third task) to participate and spread such experiences I have acquired, both from my own research and by taking part in the research of others. My conscience therefore urges me to enter the debate about evolution and design, and this must come before political correctness.

Second, this is how all empirical science is based on assumptions of faith. All attempts to let only empirical data guide natural science (such as logical positivism) have failed. These beliefs become especially important in questions of origin, because we cannot replicate through repeated experiments how life arose, or how the diversity of life with different species arose. Therefore, every researcher who engages in origin issues will be more or less guided by their origin assumptions and beliefs. So do I. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and Lord, aged 23-24, and over the years have realized more and more how trustworthy and reliable the Bible is. I am therefore convinced that design-inspired or biblically inspired (and falsifiable) models provide the best explanation for genetic, geological and morphological data. But I don't want to force these explanations on others, but let ID and creationist models compete on the same terms as secular models. It is with sadness in my heart that I see how methodological naturalism has gradually narrowed (and forced) science into a secular direction since the 18th century. This has affected the entire development of society in a materialistic direction. Not least, the theory of evolution has had a decisive role in this process, because it constitutes the creation story of naturalism, and thus influences many other sciences. If neither God nor anything else supernatural exists, then everything must have arisen by itself, just as the theory of evolution claims. This is precisely why it is so sensitive to criticize the theory of evolution, of which Erkell's article series is a clear example. To criticize the theory of evolution is simply to question the worldview and foundations of a secular culture.

After Erkell's opening question about what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to write the fine-tuning article, he goes on to discuss the American ID think tank, the Discovery Institute, and its efforts to influence societal development away from materialism. The reason is that Thorvaldsens and I got involved in a Norwegian think tank that is positive about ID:

"But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian foundation BioCosmos. Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as "ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread intelligent design, primarily to youth and young adults, and are Norwegian partners of the Discovery Institute. Their article falls into the same pattern as countless other pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many arguments against the theory of evolution.

Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists, be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific, project.”

Since I have already argued that ID and creationism are science, I will not repeat my arguments in parts 1-5. I will content myself with stating that I neither consider TH2020 to be an example of pseudo-science or anti-science. But still, Erkell's claims are not surprising, since he so strongly advocates methodological naturalism, that is, secular science. From Erkell's horizon, therefore, a crusade against natural science is the same as a crusade against secular natural science. As I wrote in this article, I believe that biblically inspired explanations and design-inspired explanations have much better conditions than the secular models. But since I don't want to force others to take this approach, it's hardly a case of a crusade. One can rather ask the question whether Erkell is waging a crusade against all science that does not start from methodological naturalism.

In this post, I discuss the motivations of the article authors. In your reply, you write: "For more than 20 years, I have studied genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that Darwin's theory of development contains crucial flaws that are rarely mentioned, neither in school nor at university." From what you write, I suspect that you got your knowledge from creationist contexts rather than from university courses. The formulation of "crucial flaws rarely mentioned" is a classic creationist theme. But there is no science that is complete or perfect; there are gaps and "critical deficiencies" in all subjects. However, creationists are most interested in the flaws they see in evolutionary biology. This fact that the flaws are "rarely mentioned" and your talk of "political correctness" also connects to a well-known creationist theme: the atheist scientists who completely dominate science and try to stifle all opposition to the theory of evolution.

This with the third task, you have probably been put on the back foot. The university pays you to present the science and scientific view that the university stands for, not for you to present a scientific view (and a view of evolutionary biology) that the university does not stand for. As a researcher, you certainly have a lot of freedom to choose different perspectives, but I think you are probably crossing the line here.

So you write that "It is with sadness in my heart that I see how methodological naturalism has gradually narrowed (and forced) science into a secular direction since the 18th century", and here I think we have come to the core of the poodle. You see an ideological struggle between two cultures, one secular and the other spiritual. I, on the other hand, see a successful, secular, research program replacing a sterile, spiritual, program. Materialistic research has gradually replaced research on a non-materialistic basis because it actually works and produces results. I have never seen any example of successful natural science on a spiritual/religious basis.

But as I write in the seventh post in the series, I could imagine an ID-inspired research if it produced concrete results. But we are not there. All you can offer are assurances that an ID-inspired research will open up new advances by freeing science from materialistic lock-ins. However, I can't see any signs that this could be the case. I discuss this further in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design".

You avoid perhaps the most serious part of my criticism, namely that the ID project is fundamentally not about science but a political/religious project aimed at building a society completely imbued with Christian religiosity - a god state. Do you have any comment on that?

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 7) #

November 13, 2020

__Why was the article published?__

The publication of Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article is quite embarrassing for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. One could expect the journal to take drastic measures to try to restore its damaged reputation. Like withdrawing the article, firing the responsible editor and blacklisting the reviewers who were responsible for the scientific review. But they didn't do that.

Instead, they let the article stand and published a disclaimer, a dissociation, from the journal's management. It reads:

> The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments in bona fide universities). We were unaware of this fact while the paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords "intelligent design" were added by the authors after the review process during the proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors. We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

Here they distance themselves from ID as such, and they say that they did not understand that it was about ID because the keyword "intelligent design" was added by the authors only after the article had been reviewed. That is a strange statement. Firstly, because people would not have understood that it was about ID. It is enough to glance quickly through the text to recognize familiar ID themes such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity or Dembski's explanation filter. If you happen to not recognize such markers, you should ask yourself what in the world this is all about, and look it up. To not spot that this is about creationism/ID shows ignorance and carelessness on a level that is inexcusable for a scientific journal.

Secondly, I believe that it is wrong to reject an article solely for the reason that it deals with ID. It could (purely theoretically) happen that someone actually managed to find good scientific arguments for ID, and then they should of course be published. It would be a sensation. But, as we saw in the previous post, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have not managed to show anything at all. The statistical method they want to launch is useless, and consequently they have no results. The article should not have been accepted for publication for the reason that it has no scientific interest. Added to this is all the pseudoscience the article contains.

So why didn't the journal retract the article, and why did they write this strange disclaimer? One reason may be that the publisher that owns the Journal of Theoretical Biology, Elsevier, had bad experiences with retracting articles related to ID. A well-known ID proponent, the mathematician Granville Sewell, had an article in 2011 titled “A second look at the second law” accepted by Applied Mathematical Letters, also owned by Elsevier. When the editor realized that the work was pseudoscientific, it was retracted. Sewell sued the magazine, and the affair ended with the publisher being forced to pay $10,000 and also publish an apology. You probably don't want to do this again.

But how did Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article even get through the review process? One possibility is, as I said, ignorance and carelessness on a level that is unforgivable for a scientific journal. Another could be that the authors may have taken advantage of the opportunity that some journals offer, to suggest suitable reviewers themselves. If they then suggested ID-friendly people, and the editor didn't bother to read the work, the article may have gone under the radar. Then the editor himself may have been ID-friendly.

Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements of scientific integrity.

<div align="center">***</div>

Finally, what will be the answer to the question if Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article is a breakthrough for Intelligent Design? It depends on who you ask. For the Discovery Institute and the ID movement, it is a success to have received an ID-friendly article in a high-ranking scientific journal. The publication makes it easier to present ID as a scientifically legitimate theory, something that is valuable in public opinion work. At the same time, the journal's disclaimer provides an opportunity to present the ID movement as a victim and complain that you are being discriminated against by the "Darwinists". They go so far as to compare the magazine's treatment of the article to the Nazis' treatment of the Jews. The Swedish association Genesis sees the deal as a serious attack on its academic freedom and illustrates his article with an image that appears to come from a concentration camp.

From a scientific point of view, the article does not represent a scientific breakthrough for the simple reason that it contains no results. Just a useless statistical model. And that makes perfect sense; ID is not a scientific project, and it cannot produce any scientific knowledge.

__Part 7: Why was the fine-tuning article published?__

In the last and concluding part of his article series, Erkell asks himself how our article could be accepted by a reputable journal. I find no reason to comment on Erkell's speculation about the reason TH2020 was published. I am content to state that the article was reviewed according to the usual peer review procedure.

After pondering the reasons why TH2020 was published, Erkell arrives at the following conclusion:

"Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity."

Here one can ask what the basic requirements for scientific integrity are? Based on Erkell's first six articles, it is not difficult to guess that for him scientific integrity means that science must follow methodological naturalism as a principle. In other words, Erkell demands that all science be conducted with secular signs. For my part, on the contrary, I believe that the editors showed a great deal of integrity when, despite a storm of criticism from evolutionary biologists, they stuck to their decision to publish the article. As I see it, this is a healthy sign for science that gives good hope for the future.

__Conclusions from parts 1-7__

In summary, I welcome analysis of the research articles I have written, both those that contain constructive criticism and appreciation. In this context, I would like to take the opportunity to mention that not all scientists seem to have the same attitude towards mine and Thorvaldsen's article as Erkell. After TH2020 was published, I co-authored a follow-up article on waiting times to effect major genetic changes. This paper has recently been published and I have been invited to give a talk on its findings at an international conference with many well-known participants.

As I wrote in the introduction, I want to thank Lars Johan Erkell for actually taking the time to read, not only mine and Steinar's article on fine-tuning, but also several of the articles we refer to. As time permits, I am happy to continue this exchange of ideas, through articles or debates. However, I believe that much of Erkell's criticism misses the mark. First, Erkell has misunderstood what Intelligent Design or creationism means by assuming that such research is governed by non-falsifiable criteria. Secondly, Erkell makes a feather out of a chicken when he criticizes us for using the word "non-physical information", because he did not understand what we mean by this term. Third, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary is based on a materialist belief. By using methodological naturalism, Erkell thus wants to force all research to be guided by secular assumptions. For my part, I advocate a scientific environment where secular, design-based, creationist and other hypotheses are allowed to participate and compete on equal terms. I leave it to the reader to judge whether my approach or Erkell's is the most democratic and best matches the purpose of science to seek the truth.

__Reply by Lars Johan Erkell__

Finally, to the question of how TH2020 came to be published in J Theol Biol. I, and many with me, have been surprised by the matter. You write above that the article has been reviewed "according to the usual peer review procedure". The picture you get of the process in the article "Creation-based research moves the positions forward", which the association Genesis published on its website on July 9 , is a completely different one:

"During the review process, the journal's editors and reviewer advised the authors to tone down the references to Intelligent Design (ID) and replace it with the term 'fine-tuning', including in the title of the article, which was done. On the other hand, there were no objections to a discussion of ID, as well as criticism of neo-Darwinism, on the condition that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer also referred to ID-critical sources. For that reason, the authors judged in connection with the final revision that it would be relevant to have "intelligent design" as one of the keywords for the article. The word "Intelligent" was then deleted by the responsible editor (see below); the word 'intelligent' is still considered too sensitive in contexts like this."

Here we got the explanation why the article could be published: ID-friendly editors. That the journal's editors and assessors advise the authors to avoid sensitive phrases in order to go under the radar and thus be able to violate the journal's policy is not a "customary" procedure. It is also confirmed by the disclaimer that was published. Your claim that this was a "customary peer review procedure" is therefore not true, if the article on the website of the association Genesis is to be believed. I am inclined to do so.

So to my regret that the journal does not live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity. You write "Based on Erkell's first six articles, it is not difficult to guess that for him scientific integrity means that science must follow methodological naturalism as a principle". No, this has nothing to do with naturalism. It is about the fact that a scientific journal should not publish material that does not meet reasonable requirements for scientific rigor, thereby giving it legitimacy. For me, this means in this case that you don't publish material where you:

  - claim that you have shown something when you have not actually done it. The reader who is not attentive (or knowledgeable enough) is deceived.
  - present an unusable method as if it were useful. Again, you can fool the reader.
  - give the impression that concepts that are not established and well defined, such as "specificity" and "non-physical information" would actually be solid and defined. This means that reasoning can give the impression of being rigorous when in fact the concepts are so blurred that they do not make sense.
  - do not discuss weaknesses in your own model. The most glaring weakness in this case is the enormous (and by all accounts insurmountable) difficulties in calculating the probability that a structure would be designed by a non-material designer, something that is not mentioned.
  - have falsified quotations in the text.

In conclusion, you suggest that much of my criticism misses the mark for three reasons:

"Firstly, Erkell has misunderstood what Intelligent Design or creationism means, in that he assumes that such research is governed by non-falsifiable criteria". To that I answer both yes and no. I make an attempt to clarify the problem in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design"

"Secondly, Erkell makes a chicken out of a feather when he criticizes us for using the word "non-physical information", because he did not understand what we mean by this concept". It is quite true that I do not understand what you mean by "non-physical information". And that is because you yourselves do not seem to understand what you mean - you do not even attempt a definition. The only thing you come up with is a vague reference to "semantic information".

"Thirdly, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary is based on a materialist belief. By using methodological naturalism, Erkell wants to force all research to be guided by secular assumptions". This is an echo of Phillip Johnson's argument that methodological naturalism is in fact philosophical naturalism in disguise. It's not like that. Methodological naturalism is precisely methodological, it is about how to work in a purely practical way to obtain reliable research results. But ID research (to the extent that it exists at all) has not produced a single concrete result in more than 20 years (please correct me if I'm wrong). This is because they could not find any practically feasible methods for "design detection" - all they have is reasoning about how it could be done. TH2020 is another example of that thing. And because ID research does not work in practice, it is not seen as scientifically interesting.

So to democracy. You and Steinar Thorvaldsen have published an article here that openly argues for ID in J. Theor. Biol., an established scientific journal. You obviously have full freedom to devote yourself to ID within the framework of your professorships. The same goes for your fellow professors Michael Behe, Stuart Burgess and Scott Minnich, to mention three names that come to mind at the moment. So of course it is permissible to work with ID, and it is possible to publish in the scientific press. But of course you have difficulty getting research grants, and that's not so strange - a completely ordinary, secular, research program that hasn't produced any results for more than 20 years wouldn't get a penny either.

You write that you are happy to continue our exchange of ideas through articles or debates. It was fun, I do too, but I'm not particularly interested in debates. A written exchange with well-thought-out lines, like the one we have now, gives much more. And these are important questions we have to address: what is legitimate science, and where are the limits of science?
