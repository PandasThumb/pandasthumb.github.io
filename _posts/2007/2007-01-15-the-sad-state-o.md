On Uncommon Descent, our friend Davescot shows once again why Intelligent Design has to hide in the shades of our ignorance. Richard B Hoppe has dealt with most of what he called [Dissent Out of Bounds on Uncommon Dissent (Oops, make that "Descent")](/archives/2007/01/dissent-out-of.html) and this posting is meant to archive the excellent comments by Febble which caused so much concern at UcD.

While UcD is well known for its aggressive moderation policies, deleting much of anything critical of ID and quickly banning those who expose ID's scientific and religious vacuities, Uncommon Dissent seems to also favor squashing unfavorable reviews of its theses. In a thread titled [ID in the UK](http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1925) ID activist Bill Dembski invited comments from people in the United Kingdom to comment on the recent 'activities' of ID in this country. 

A poster, named Febble complied with the invitation and politely expressed her feelings. Soon thereafter Davescot banned Febble from participating on UcD. Why? Read on

Febble introduced herself as "... a scientist, a Christian theist, and a UK citizen, with a son in a UK secondary school. This is my response to your encouragement to comment."

She points out that ID, as a scientific hypothesis (sic) defines intelligence in a manner which includes natural selection as the designer. This conclusion was long since reached by others, including Wesley Elsberry, but it seems that ID activists are largely unfamiliar with the impact of Dembski's musings and unwilling to take it where it leads.

Far from rejecting an agent "with the power and facility to choose between options", this is exactly what the Theory of Evolution postulates as the agent of evolutionary change - a process of_selection_ (aka "choice") between options. 

The responses were varied but invariably hasty and avoiding the issue raised by Febble.

But first let's look at the full response by Febble and save it for posterity since ID sites have a history of having embarassing postings disappear.

Febble wrote:

> The fact that the selection process postulated by the ToE is a "natural" one ("Natural Selection") does not disqualify it from being an agent "with the power and facility to choose between options". This is exactly what it does, by means of a simple IF...THEN selection algorithm. IF a variant survives THEN it replicates. Variants with greater capacity to survive are selected (chosen), while those with lesser capacity are rejected.

Suggesting that life-forms have the appearance of "intelligent design" using a definition of intelligence that would NOT cover Natural Selection (e.g. one that invoked intentionality) would not, as you say, be science at all.
> 
> I am therefore opposed to the Truth In Science materials. 

After her introduction, Febble continued to participate in a very polite manner by educating ID activists as to the vacuity of their arguments and claims. In her response, she also unveiled her true identity as Elizabeth Liddle

Febble wrote:

Dr Dembski's ID argument is that it is the quality ("specified"), not the quantity, of the complexity exhibited by living things that identifies them as having been produced by an intelligent agent, for which he provides an operational definition. Natural Selection possesses "intelligence" according to that operational defines it. As such, it can produce specified complexity. Whether it can produce enough "complexity" to account for the variety of life is separate issue.

But I refer you again to Dr Dembski's definition of intelligence for the purpose of inferring an intelligent designer from observed patterns (e.g. in a signal picked up by SETI), namely "the power and facility to choose between options". Natural Selection has this power and facility. It's how it works. It's also why it's called selection. (BTW, you assumed I'm male. I'm female, as it happens.)

And, as Dr Dembski defines it, an intelligence "with the power and facility to choose between options" is indeed capable of, as you put it "inputting new information into the system". It's how computers work. You may not believe it is capable of making a cell work, but that is not the debate here. The debate is whether ID, as defined by Dr Dembski is a scientific hypothesis. It is. And it describes Natural Selection very nicely.

Elizabeth Liddle has quite a name on the Internet. [On Mystery Pollster](http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2005/week17/index.html) she is disclosed to have developed a model which analyzed voting behavior.

> The Liddle Model That Could

> Regular readers of this blog may know her as "Febble," the diarist from [DailyKos](http://febble.dailykos.com/).  Her real name is Elizabeth Liddle, a 50-something mother and native of Scotland who originally trained as a classical musician and spent most of her life performing, composing and recording renaissance and baroque music.  She also studied architecture and urban design before enrolling in a PhD program in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Nottingham where she is currently at work on a dissertation on the neural correlates of dyslexia.  In her spare time, she wrote a [children's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802852572/qid=1114765610/sr=8-6/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i6_xgl14/002-9776826-1512046?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846) and developed in interest in American politics while posting on the British Labor party on DailyKos.  A self proclaimed "fraudster" she came to believe our election "may well have been rigged," that "real and massive vote suppression" occurred in Ohio where the recount was "a sham" and the Secretary of State "should be jailed."

Quite a history... But let's return to Febble's plight on UcD:

Her insightful and polite postings led Davescot to quickly ban her from participating

Davescot wrote:

What is truly fascinating is the level of ignorance found in the comments by ID activists, including our dear friend Davescot who seems quite confused about the concept of natural selection and information. Which is not surprising given that most of these posters have gotten their ill founded information from Bill Dembski's writings.

But once again I digress from the remarkable performance of "Febble"

Faced with the impeccable logic of "Febble" ID activists are scurrying for responses, thus we find a poster named Patrick claiming that the 
Febble "... go read the UD archives. That claim has been repeated so many times it's not funny."

Febble, not easily distracted, inquires politely as to the nature of the claim to which Patrick seems to be referring.

Patrick, not constrained by any logic, 'responds'

> Febbles: First off, Dave and everyone here is fully aware that OOL is different from TOE. Whenever a Darwinist comes on here and blindly starts "lecturing" I just roll my eyes. Secondly, run a search on "genetic algorithms" because that is obviously what you're referring to.

No real response, but then again, addressing "Febble's" comments is no easy task, in fact it is a task which Dembski has mostly neglected himself.

Lizzie then goes for the jugular in a very polite manner

My point was simply that if intelligence, for the purpose of inferring an "intelligent designer" from an example of "specified complexity" is defined as "the power and facility to choose between options" (and I agree with Dr. Dembski that an agent with such power is required to produce a pattern with "specified complexity"), then natural selection has that power and facility.

Patrick continues to make some vague references to Lizzie's claim and she takes the opportunity to invite him to give some specifics

Febble wrote:

> Hi, Patrick

My "claim", as I see it, is simply that yes, the complexity we see in life forms has a quality that Dr. Dembski has defined as "specified" - the quality that emerges when a pattern is produced from what he calls an "intelligence". And he defines that "intelligence" as "the power and facility to choose between options". My argument is simply that natural selection is an agent that "has the power and facility to choose between options" - which is why life forms exhibit "specified complexity" - and is therefore a form of "intelligence" as defined by Dr Dembski.

It learns by trial and error - it repeats responses that lead to success. In fact, what it learns is optimal response times. It learns that if it is too slow it may miss its target, but if it is too fast it may respond to the wrong target. It actually starts with a flat distribution of reaction times, and I end with a distribution with a peak . Sometimes, depending on the contingencies, I get a bimodal distribution. When I change the contingencies, and it has to learn a new set of responses - and the distribution of response times changes. It's very simple though, just a fairly basic population model. But like actual populations, it tends towards the currently optimal solution. And what it models is actual intelligence - learning and set shifting, as seen in actual human behaviour.

It did not arise by chance, it arose from rules - algorithms. And a key algorithm is the if...then statement. In that sense, I consider Dr Dembski correct - biological systems are intelligent systems, arising from intelligent processes.

I am happy with Dr. Dembki's operational definition of intelligence, which includes the concept of choice between options, but does not include consciousness or intention. Dr Dembski does not argue, as I understand him, that consciousness or intention are necessary to produce a pattern with "specified complexity", merely the "power and capacity to choose between options".

Patrick, lost for logic attempts the appeal to authority approach

On re-reading it, I still find that up until that point in the article, Dr. Dembski makes perfect and elegant sense. CSI has to be the result of Actualisation-Exclusion-Specification, and Specification must be the result of choice. To quote Dr Dembski:
> 
> > The word "intelligent" derives from two Latin words, the preposition inter, meaning between, and the verb lego, meaning to choose or select. Thus according to its etymology, intelligence consists in choosing between. It follows that the etymology of the word "intelligent" parallels the formal analysis of intelligent causation just given. "Intelligent design" is therefore a thoroughly apt phrase, signifying that design is inferred precisely because an intelligent cause has done what only an intelligent cause can do-make a choice.

>

> >     If chance and necessity left to themselves cannot generate CSI, is it possible that chance and necessity working together might generate CSI? The answer is No. Whenever chance and necessity work together, the respective contributions of chance and necessity can be arranged sequentially. But by arranging the respective contributions of chance and necessity sequentially, it becomes clear that at no point in the sequence is CSI generated. Consider the case of trial-and-error (trial corresponds to necessity and error to chance). Once considered a crude method of problem solving, trial-and-error has so risen in the estimation of scientists that it is now regarded as the ultimate source of wisdom and creativity in nature. The probabilistic algorithms of computer science (e.g., genetic algorithms-see Forrest, 1993) all depend on trial-and-error. So too, the Darwinian mechanism of mutation and natural selection is a trial-and-error combination in which mutation supplies the error and selection the trial. An error is committed after which a trial is made. But at no point is CSI generated.

All we observe is that the rat has learned the maze. And Dr Dembski tells us, correctly of course, that if the rat makes the correct sequence of left and right turns, we can infer from that the fact that the pattern of its behaviour exhibits CSI that it was produced by an intelligent agent, namely the rat. In his own next words:

> So it would appear that Dr. Dembski believes that learned behaviour can be recognized by its CSI, and inferred to be intelligent behaviour. Which is fine. But we know that learning can proceed by trial-and-error -- indeed many of the cognitive tasks we use in cognitive psychology can only be solved by trial and error. So it does not follow, to my mind, that a pattern that is arrived at by trial and error cannot generate CSI. The rat demonstrates that it can.

> He rules out chance as a source of CSI, as of course we must do. Chance, is, after all, the null hypothesis in any signal detection test. But he also rules out necessity. He does so by reasoning that if A must lead to B, observing B tells us no more about A than we know already from A. But consider this: if we have a "natural" choice maker, such as a perfect filter, or sieve, and a supply of particles of varying size, then we will find ourselves with a sorted arrangement of particles that cannot have arisen by chance -- the pattern of the sorted particles exhibits CSI. We can infer the rule that generated the pattern:_particles smaller than a certain threshold pass, but larger particles are retained._ I assume that Dr. Dembski would not want to call such a perfect filter "intelligent" -- although it clearly has "the power and capacity to choose between options": it chooses the large particles and releases the small ones. And I would agree that a sieve is not what we would normally call intelligent, although it fulfills Dr. Dembski's operational definition. So why would Dr Dembski not infer an intelligent agent from something a pattern that had resulted from a natural sieve?
> 
> Well, he tells us that the pattern generated by the sieve cannot exhibit CSI because no new information has been added. And it is true that if we knew the precise mesh size of the sieve in advance, and the sizes of every particle, the piles of particles wouldn't tell us anything new about what pattern would be generated by the sieve. But in that case would a sieve with randomly fluctuating mesh size produce piles of particles that exhibited CSI? And could we then infer an intelligent sieve? Well, clearly not. All we'd have is an unreliable sieve instead of a perfect one. An unreliable sieve is not more intelligent than a perfect sieve.
> 
> In other words, the pattern of sorted sand, which appears to me to exhibit CSI, cannot, according to Dr. Dembski have CSI, simply because we know everything about the sieve. His argument therefore appears to be not that, as he claims, that we can infer intelligence from a pattern that appears to exhibit CSI, but from the degree to which we have less-than-perfect knowledge about about the mechanism that created the pattern. Thus we can infer that the rat is intelligent, not from the CSI generated by its behaviour, but _because we do not know everything about what determined the rat's choices._Conversely, we infer that the sieve is not intelligent, not because the pattern it generates does not have CSI (it does), but because we can know, in principle, everything about the sieve.
> 
> This is the problem I have with Dr. Dembski's analysis. I agree with him that CSI is detectable. I agree with him that if is detectable we can infer that it was generated by something with "a power and capacity to choose between options". I do not agree with him that that we can distinguish between a "natural" choice-maker, like a sieve, and an "intelligent" choice maker, like a rat, by observing the differences between the patterns they generate. Both will generate patterns that exhibit CSI. But if intelligence is to be inferred from the amount of new information contained in the pattern, this quantity will depend not simply on the pattern, but on what we know about the factors that determine the choice-making of the choice-making agent. The more we know about the choice algorithm (whether rat or sieve), the less new information will be gained by examining the pattern. Once we know everything about the rat's brain, will the rat cease to be intelligent?
> 
> No, because, in my view, is that there is no difference between the two agents. The amount of new information (in Dr. Dembski's terms) contained in the pattern generated by a trial-and-error learning algorithm in a computer only differs from the trial-and-error learning process in a rat because we know the algorithm -- because we wrote it. And the pattern produced by a "natural" filter only differs from the pattern produced by the rat in that the rules that govern the pattern are more amenable to inference by a diligent scientist.

> As a Christian, I believe in free will. I believe we are responsible, in some cosmic and meaningful sense, for our own actions. But I do not believe free will can be inferred from our behaviour. To an outside observer, our behaviour could as easily be entirely deterministic. If so, even the patterns generated by our intelligent behaviour would add no information to what an ideal observer already knew from the initial conditions of our neurons. Belief in free will seems to me to be as much an act of faith as belief in God -- indeed, belief in God is not possible without belief in free will. And I make that act of faith by believing in God. But we cannot infer an agent with free will from patterns that exhibit CSI. We can only infer "intelligence", as defined, by Dr. Dembski, as the "power and capacity to choose between options". Which is also possessed by a sieve.

No discussion of Dembski's work and CSI can proceed very far without getting into probabilities yet you didn't use the word (or any derivative) even once.

Never mind that Davescot does not address Lizzie's comments, he quickly focuses on what he perceives to be a shortcoming in her arguments, namely that she does not use the term probability. Of course, in her analysis of Dembski's own words, Lizzie has to do nothing more than quote and analyze where Dembski's 'arguments' lead.

Perhaps Davescot was not aware of Lizzie's history in data analysis and probabilities or he would not have chosen this particular path. In hindsight...

For a highly specified pattern (say a unique pattern of 100 ones and zeros), and where even a near miss was as bad as a complete failure, then, yes, you would need to search a very large space with a very small probability of success. But that is a very specialised kind of search. Memory of near-misses won't help, because you have no feedback until you hit the jackpot. You just have to keep trying every combination, until you win. But random selection and natural selection isn't that kind of search. It's more like the game of hangman (even a game of hangman where the target is a random letter string). You guess at random, but when you get a correct answer for one slot, you get to keep it. You replicate what works, in other words. You don't start from scratch each time.

But, as you yourself pointed out, even modern single-celled organisms are far from simple, and have had (as I believe the evidence strongly suggests) several billion years in which to get their act together. My assumption is that the first prototypes of life (whether on this planet or elsewhere in the universe) would have been replicating molecules, with the replication governed by catalysts. As replication is the key to "learning" (in both evolving biological systems and elementary schools) then something that replicates has to be the starting point. Once you have a molecule that replicates, then you have a key element for a learning algorithm in place. Natural Selection being the other. All you need in addition is a bit of stochastic resonance. Actually, the concept of resonance is the key to all this, IMO - positive feedback loops.

I do not agree that the evidence suggests that "Natural Selection is a conservative force", and nor do I consider that the evidence supports the hypothesis of less-than-disastrous mutations piling up.

And where animals are in competition for resources, environment and genes will often interact, with the healthiest animals gaining more benefit - in terms of reproductive success - from the environmental bounty than the less healthy. So there is no particular reason for expecting "build up" of deleterious mutations in a population, even in good times. And, in contrast to your model, when times are hard, those individuals carrying genes that already compromise their chances of successful reproduction are more likely to be "purged" from the population than those carrying more reproductively advantageous genes. Although clearly, some mutations will be advantageous under certain environmental conditions, and disadvantageous under others. So you would expect, under this hypothesis, for times of rapid environmental events to coincide with rapid extinction events and rapid rates of speciation.

Because, to return to the subject of Dr. Dembski's OP, that "rm+ns" is an intelligent system. It chooses and it learns, and thus tends towards optimal solutions for current conditions.

But in any case if you are arguing (as I think you should not) that the fossil record indicates the emergence of abrupt novel features, then it puzzles me that you should then comment:

Incremental change, which is what is postulated by the Theory of Evolution would not lead to the prediction of "novel tissue types, organs and body plans" when observed at the sampling rate possible through observations recorded by human beings in historical times. What we see instead, as predicted by the ToE, is incremental adaptation, and occasionally the beginnings of speciation. The "abrupt" changes in the fossil record are not abrupt over a historical time-scale.

Adding insult to injury, when the probablistic resources of rm+ns are scrutinized with 21st century knowledge of the complexities involved that particular fiction doesn't even pass the giggle test.
>

It seems much more probable to me, and consistent with both the fossil and the genetic evidence, that modern bacteria and baboons are the end products of separate lines of incremental change from an common ancestor that probably resembles neither. So I don't even share your premise. And so I don't find the postulate either incredible or funny. But all postulates are, in a sense "fiction" - science isn't about certainty, as I'm sure you would agree, but about provisional models of reality that are always subject to potential falsification.

Nothing so far of Lizzie's arguments against Dembski. But then again, Sal, 'I will take a grenade for Dembski' is not there to argue these uncomfortable points.

For me, intelligent processes are natural, and figuring out their nature is what earns me my living.

But I regard that view as an act of faith - I do believe, as I said upthread, in individual responsibility on some cosmic scale that matters. I think it matters to God. I define God to myself as the entity to whom my actions ultimately matter, and who is present in everyone. But enough theology...

I assume it was designed by the same kinds of process by which I think - in fact, by which Imyself "design" By a natural intelligence. And I consider the mechanism by which variance in our genetic inheritance interacts with natural selective pressures is an intelligent system. An extremely intelligent system, though not, I suggest a conscious one (although I suppose you might conceivable call it the mind of God....).

As I said, upthread, ordinary English usage would not allow a sieve, and certainly not an unreliable sieve, to be called "intelligent". But if we define intelligence as Dr. Dembski has done as, essentially, being an agent with the power of choice between options, then the reductio ad absurdum is to a sieve. Or, more sensibly, any "natural law".

> I think one of the most misleading words in the whole debate, in fact, is the word "random". Without getting into whether or not the universe is deterministic or not (and I'll stick with the quantum physicists who say that it is not), for practical purposes, things have causes. Chemistry is full of rules. Some things bind to other things in a particular way. Some things have affinities for other things; some things don't mix, like oil and water. Some things are catalysts, and affect the way other things bond. This system of rules means that natural algorithms are occurring all the time, and varied, often complex structures and compounds are the result. Now this all might be the product of a vastly intelligent First Mover, or it might just be the Way Things Are. But it is, nonetheless, the Way Things Are, now, and were, as I consider the evidence suggests, on the earth four billion years ago. And I see no intrinsic reason to doubt that, given that we are here now, as complex organisms whose minds and bodies function by means of complex cascades of chemical "if...then" algorithms, that we didn't emerge from much simpler chemical algorithms four billion years ago.

As soon as it diversified, with different forces having different rules, it became a vast algorithm, generating complexity, not by "chance" but by a sequence of algorithms so complex (and at stochastic at a quantum level) that "random" is often a convenient shorthand by which to describe it. I don't think we are the result of random processes. I think we are the result of intelligent processes, and that that intelligence, as with our own, is embodied in the "natural laws" that govern the matter of which we - and the entire universe - are made.

However, it does do a form of planning that we also do, and so do less intelligent animals, which is that it learns. While it may not plan novel strategies de novo or from observation, it learns from direct experience, as we do. If it makes a mistake, it doesn't repeat the mistake. It makes sure that in the future it does what worked last time. So in that limited sense, yes, it "plans". It "chooses" what worked, rather than what didn't. And like us, sometimes it gets lucky by accident, and remembers that trick too.

Trial-and-error learning involves, well, learning . It's much more efficient than random search because you learn from your successes and your mistakes. Natural selection + replication with modification also learns from both its successes and its mistakes, which makes it moderately intelligent.

I'm probably predisposed to see the evolutionary mechanism as "intelligent" because it's the kind of mechanism I model when I am trying to model intelligent behaviour - particularly learning. And one thing that human beings do when they learn is learn bad habits. And instead of correcting their bad habits, they learn to compensate with some learned behaviour. The classic icons of "bad design" would, in my terms be "bad habits". Some of them are cool though. I do like those weird wasps.

Causing Davescot to express his ignorance for all to see

Davescot wrote:

> You're still making mistakes in describing rm+ns. Saying it learns from mistakes is misleading. It needs constant reinforcement of what it learns or it forgets even faster than it learned. This known as conservation of genomic information. Anything that is not immediately useful (no selection value) is not conserved within the genome forever. The genomic information with no immediate use gets peppered with random mutations and quickly becomes useless as a result. This is really basic stuff you don't know.

Of course, Davescot did not allow Febble to respond to his ignorant posting.

And that is, my dear friends, the sad story of Intelligent Design, who invites people to comment on a particular event and when a well informed person politely responds, in a manner devastating to the cause, the person is treated with non-sequitors and other fallacies. And when it becomes clear that she has gained the upper hand in the discussions, she is unceremoniously booted out.

Not only is ID scientifically and theologically vacuous, it also is not ready for any peer review. I wonder if ID activists who are rooting for 'teaching the controversy' where expecting a form of 'controversy' about their own thesis... How ironically appropriate to see how ID is forced back into the shadows of our ignorance.
Next time, I bet that ID activists will be more careful in chosing their opponents, and avoid anyone who is familiar with [uncovering 'fraud'.](http://www.geocities.com/lizzielid/WPEpaper.pdf)

> The pattern instead is consistent with the E-M  hypothesis of "reluctant Bush responders", provided we postulate a large degree of  variance in the degree and direction of bias across precinct types.   Mathematically, the observed pattern could arise from widespread fraud as well as from widespread response bias; differential vote spoilage rates for Kerry votes, or "ballot stuffing" of Bush votes, would produce results indistinguishable from "reluctant Bush responders." However, this is not the inference currently drawn from the data by USCV in their report.
