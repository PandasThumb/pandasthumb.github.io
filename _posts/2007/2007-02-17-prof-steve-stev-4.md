<img src="/uploads/2006/head.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />[Prof. Steve Steve](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/steve_steve/) and his trusty sidekick Nick Matzke plan to be at the NCSE booth at the [AAAS Annual Meeting](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/) at the Hilton in downtown San Francisco from 10-5, Saturday, February 17.  I know many PT people and ScienceBloggers are at the meeting, so stop by and see us! ([transport info](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/03_GI/Info_03_Ground_Transpt.shtml#sfo_bart)) 

Prof. Steve Steve, and perhaps Nick, will also be in attendance on Sunday and Monday.  It looks like Saturday and Sunday have free Exhibit Hall admission on account of [2007 Family Science Days](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/02_PE/PE_11_FSD.shtml).

As with every AAAS meeting, the true goal is to get invited to the Science Journalists' Party, which I hope is Saturday night.  They always throw quite a bash, although it will be hard to trump the molten chocolate fountain from the DC meeting a few years back.
