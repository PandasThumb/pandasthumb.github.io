<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemaris_diffinis"><i>Hemaris diffinis</i></a> &ndash; bumblebee moth at butterfly bush. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "I spotted this one while on the phone, and it was cooperative enough to still be at the bush when I returned with the camera (still on the phone too &ndash; headsets are very handy). The butterfly bush (<i>Buddleia davidii</i>) seemed to be almost intoxicating, since I was able to work very close to the various pollinators visiting that day. Bumblebee moths (<i>H. diffinis</i>) and their close relatives  hummingbird clearwings (<i>H. thysbe</i>) demonstrate very good examples of aposematic coloration, mimicking less tasty species to avoid predators. They're easy to spot at a distance, however, by knowing a few simple traits. Bumblebees always land on the flower they're feeding from, while <i>Hemaris</i> never do, and true hummingbirds move much faster and dart back and forth. It would seem, however, that predators haven't tumbled to this yet...."
