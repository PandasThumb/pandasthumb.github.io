<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolvulus_arvensis"><i>Convolvulus arvensis</i></a> &ndash; field bindweed, also previously known as wild morning glory. I read once that there is only one bindweed plant in the entire world, and its root is at the center of the earth. More realistically, I think there is only one bindweed plant in Boulder County, and its root is in my backyard, where it passes for lawn.
