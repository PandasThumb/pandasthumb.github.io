<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Great_Horned_Owl/overview"><i>Bubo virginianus</i></a> &ndash; great horned owl, Boulder County, Colorado, April 7, 2018. The photographer says, "We visited a very nice family for a little while earlier this afternoon. They were hanging out [on a cliff] just west of McCaslin on South Boulder Road, and about 20 feet up. One of the adults was away but the other and the two kids were at home. Some other visitors said the adults were here two years ago without kids, weren't to be found last year, and returned this year with the little ones coming along not long after!" The adult who was away was alleged to be bringing treats for the kids.
