At the time, I was relatively new to _Pandas_.  However, even back then it struck me that _Pandas_ was a particularly important work, because it was published in 1989 and thus substantially predated the rest of the "intelligent design" corpus.  At the time, I [remarked](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8442_1_introduction_iof_pandas__11_23_2004.asp) that:

> \[_Pandas_\] was the first book to frequently use now-common buzzwords such as "intelligent design," "design proponents," and "design theory." As such, Pandas represents the beginning of the modern "intelligent design" movement.

My primary source for this was the Preface that Jon Buell had written for the fabled "third edition" of _Pandas_, to be published as _The Design of Life_.  In the Preface, Buell (head of the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, the group that produced _Pandas_) [wrote](http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/05/new-edition-of-id-textbook-most.html),

> A decade has passed since _Of Pandas and People_'s second edition appeared in print. Written by Percival Davis and Dean Kenyon, this book was the first intelligent design textbook. In fact, it was the first place where the phrase "intelligent design" appeared in its present use.

(This Preface was freely online at William Dembski's [DesignInference.com website](http://www.designinference.com/) for much of 2004, but was taken down about the time [_Kitzmiller v. Dover_](http://www2.ncseweb.org) was filed in December 2004 -- see [Wayback archive](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.designinference.com), where it [can still be downloaded](http://web.archive.org/web/20040924002633/http://designinference.com/), and a [May 2004 blog post](http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/05/new-edition-of-id-textbook-most.html) quoting the beginning of Buell's Preface.)

In 2004, one would have thought that everything that could be said about _Pandas_ had already been said, between [15 years of negative reviews](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21), [Jay Wexler's law review article](http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/archive/newsletters/v98n1/law/abstracts.asp), and Frank Sonleitner's [epic book-length critique](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3804_49_sonleitner_1994_what_12_7_2004.asp) of _Pandas_.  However, over the course of the _Kitzmiller_ case, a great deal of new information was learned about the origin and evolution of _Pandas_.  

The first sentence of the Acknowledgements section of _Pandas_ states cryptically that "_Of Pandas and People_ went through an evolution of its own" (_Pandas_, 1993, p. iii).  However, it was not realized how literally true this was until unpublished drafts of _Pandas_ were subpoenaed by the [_Kitzmiller_](http://www2.ncseweb.org) plaintiffs during the discovery period in the case.  The basics hit the [_Wall Street Journal_](/archives/2005/09/why-didnt-they.html) and [other newspapers](/archives/2005/07/creationist-cre.html) before Barbara Forrest testified in the trial: _Pandas_ was conceived and written as a classic creationist "two models" text, and only later was converted into an "intelligent design" book.  

Strangely, just a few days before Forrest's testimony, the Discovery Institute released an article purporting to be a "[Brief History of the Scientific Theory of Intelligent Design](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2885&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20History%20and%20Philosophy%20of%20Science%20-%20MainPage)."  It included brand-new interviews with Charles Thaxton and other ID pioneers, and was obviously intended to rebut [Forrest's expert report](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?page_id=12).  But both interviewers and interviewees neglected to mention the minor facts that _Pandas_ was the first book to systematically use the term "intelligent design", and that the book evolved directly from a creationist book.

When Forrest testified, many more details came out, including the names and dates of unpublished drafts of _Pandas_, and the fact that the switch from creationism to ID involved little change in content, and instead was merely a crude word switch between variants on "creation" and variants on "intelligent design."   Furthermore, the switch apparently occurred after the [_Edwards v. Aguillard_ decision](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html) against "creation science" was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 19, 1987.  Forrest's testimony is now online, but the short version is summarized in this [_New Scientist_ article](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8061), "[Book thrown at proponents of Intelligent Design](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8061)".  

Since I don't think it has been blogged, for posterity, here is the list of the known drafts of _Pandas_ that were introduced in the _Kitzmiller_ case last Wednesday:

> _Creation Biology_ (1983)
> _Biology and Creation_ (1986)
> _Biology and Origins_ (1987)
> _Of Pandas and People_ (1987, version 1, creationist version)
> _Of Pandas and People_ (1987, version 2, "intelligent design" version)
> _Of Pandas and People_ (1989, published 1st edition)
> _Of Pandas and People_ (1993, published 2nd edition)

Only after after Forrest testified did the ID movement finally bring itself to acknowledge, in a vague way, the existence of this skeleton in their closet.  On October 6 the Discovery Institute put out "[ Dover Trial Witness Plays Misleading Word Games In Effort to Redefine Intelligent Design](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2921&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News)."  Make sure you are not drinking anything before you [read the article](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2921&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News).

> "It was only in that very generic sense that the book used the notion of "creation" -- that is, that signs of plan, purpose, and intelligence in nature point to an intelligent cause," added Luskin. "Pandas makes it explicitly clear in many instances that they are not postulating a supernatural cause, because to do so would go beyond the limits of science. No 'word-processor-conspiracy-theory' from Forrest can change the fact that Pandas' arguments were always distinct from those of traditional 'creationism'."

The "word-processor-conspiracy-theory" bit is apparently a reference to this sequence of quotes that Forrest displaying from the _Pandas_ drafts during her testimony:

> Creation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact--fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (_Biology and Creation_ 1986, FTE 3015, p. 2-10)
> 
> Creation means that various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent Creator with their distinctive features already intact--fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (_Biology and Origins_ 1987, FTE 3235, p. 2-13)
> 
> Creation means that various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent Creator with their distinctive features already intact--fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (_Pandas_ 1987, creationist version, FTE 4996-4997, pp. 2-14, 2-15)
> 
> Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact--fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (_Pandas_ 1987, intelligent design version, FTE 4667, p. 2-15)
> 
> Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact -- fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (Pandas 1989, 1st edition, published, pp. 99-100)
> 
> Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact -- fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc. (Pandas 1993, 2nd edition, published, pp. 99-100)

Well, I guess "intelligent design" really is creationism after all.  Can anyone seriously argue that this refers to anything other than special creation?  

But perhaps this change was isolated, just one instance in hundreds of pages?  Forrest was asked about this in court.  In response, she put up the following two charts. (These charts have been [put up](http://aclupa.blogspot.com/2005/10/rose-by-any-other-name.html) on the [ACLU-PA blog](http://aclupa.blogspot.com/), so they are released to the public.  Hat-tip to [Red State Rabble](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2005/10/of-pandas-and-people-exhibits-document.html) for noticing the blogpost.  I happen to have less blurry versions that I am posting here.)  Each chart contains word counts for each draft.

The first chart shows the number of times the character strings "creation" and "design" appear in the drafts.  These strings can appear in a number of contexts ("creationism", "creation means...", "design theory"), but nevertheless there is one obvious, dramatic change across the drafts:

However, there are a few contexts in the drafts where the words "creation" and "design" might not refer to creationism and intelligent design.  So, a second search was done on the more specific strings "creationis" (catches "creationism" and "creationist", etc.) and "intelligent design":

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2005/Forrest_chart2.png" alt="Forrest testimony, Word Count Chart #2 showing how Pandas drafts switched from &apos;creationis&apos; to &apos;intelligent design&apos;." width="810" height="463" style="" />

As you can see, the results are even more dramatic.

There is more to say both about the drafts (this just scratches the surface!), about the story of how their existence was uncovered (This is why [NCSE](http://www.ncseweb.org/) is important.  [Join NCSE!](http://www.ncseweb.org/membership.asp)), and about the implications (many of the top ID proponents  must have known about this, and have been hiding it for over 15 years).  But much of it will have to wait until after the trial, and in any event this is a stunning enough development that it will take awhile for the significance to sink in.  For the moment it is enough to say that any future writing on the history of the ID movement will have to take these facts into account in order to be credible.
