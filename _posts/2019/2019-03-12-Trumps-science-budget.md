<br/>What Mr. Trump's record-setting $5 trillion budget includes, <a href ="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/us/politics/trump-budget.html">according to Jim Tankersley and Michael Tackett</a> in the <i>Times</i>: a 5&nbsp;% increase in military spending, more than the military asked for; $9 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico; and cuts of $2 trillion from "mandatory safety-net programs," such as Medicare and Medicaid.

What Mr. Trump's record-setting $5 trillion budget also includes, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/trump-once-again-requests-deep-cuts-us-science-spending">according to the news staff of Science Magazine</a>:

> a cut of $5 billion, or 13&nbsp; %, in the NIH budget

> a cut of 8&nbsp;% in NASA's science portfolio

> a cut of $1 billion, or 12&nbsp;%, in the NSF budget; a cut of $5.5 billion, or 17&nbsp;% in DOE's Office of Science, and virtual elimination of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy

 > a cut of nearly $3 billion to the Environmental Protection Agency and a cut of $440 million, or 40&nbsp;%;

> a cut of $300 million, or 30 &nbsp; %, in the NIST budget, including (perhaps surprisingly) elimination of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership

The science staff notes that the president's science advisor, <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/01/kelvin-droegemeir.html">Kelvin Droegemeier</a>, perhaps predictably, 

> calls the request “an important down payment on America’s future.” A statement from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which he leads, says the president’s budget “promotes responsible spending [by] prioritizing high-impact programs that have been shown to be effective.”

> The OSTP statement cites artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science, wireless 5G communications, and advanced manufacturing as administration priorities. It says the request would allocate $850 million for AI development and $430 million for quantum science across several agencies. But it’s impossible to tell whether that level of investment is higher or lower than current spending. 

> What is clear, however, is that those investments would be part of a diminished federal research enterprise. ...

They conclude,

> Overall, White House officials say their goal is to cut spending on domestic and foreign aid programs by about 5% below this year’s levels while increasing military spending. At the same time, the administration says it wants to generally abide by a 2011 law that calls for reducing nondefense spending by 9% and defense spending by 11% in 2020, compared with this year’s spending.
