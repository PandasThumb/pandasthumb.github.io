<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_heron"><i>Butorides virescens</i></a> &ndash; green heron. Mr. Burnett writes, "This is in the same pond as my <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/05/trachemys-scrip.html">turtle pictures</a> a few [as of 2016] years ago. There's a pair of them living around the pond, but they're so shy I haven't found a nest yet."
