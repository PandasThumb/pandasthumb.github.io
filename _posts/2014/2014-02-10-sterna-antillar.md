<big>[_Sterna antillarum browni_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Least_Tern) -- California least tern.   Mr. Fazio writes, "This species is listed as endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act. It nests along the California coast on sandy shorelines; as humans have encroached, the tern has lost much of its nesting habitat and now nests in overcrowded sites or mudflats, making them more prone to predation."</big>
