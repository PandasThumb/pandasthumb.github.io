<big>[_Petroica macrocephala_](http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/tomtit) -- South Island tomtit, New Zealand.  Mr. Duerr writes, "I would never have been  able to get such a close up photo of such a small bird if it weren't  for the fact that birds in NZ are designed not to be afraid of  humans."</big>
