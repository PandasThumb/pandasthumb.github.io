<big>[_Larus delawarensis_](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ring-billed_Gull/id) -- ring-billed gull, Boulder, Colorado. There is right now a fairly large flock at Walden Ponds east of Boulder. They are too far away to get a picture, unless you like snapshots of an array of gray-and-white ellipses.  But this one very kindly landed in a [parking lot](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/science/why-do-sea-gulls-like-parking-lots.html) and posed long enough to enable this portrait.</big>
