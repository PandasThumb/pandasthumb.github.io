Dan Phelps, President of the Kentucky Paleontological Society, invites us to watch a [YouTube presentation](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=geRFKxUDdlo&amp;feature=youtu.be) of a paper he and his colleagues, Kent Ratajeski and Joel Duff, presented at the recent national meeting of the Geographical Society of America. Watch it and, as Professor Ratajeski says, you can save the $40 admission fee, plus the $10 parking fee. And you will also find certain creationist myths debunked by these scientists, two of whom, Professors Ratajeski and Duff, are themselves evangelical Christians and can talk to creationists on their own terms. Here is what we received from Mr. Phelps:

> Since I am a long-time critic of creationism and the Ark here in Kentucky and had visited the park on opening day, I was invited to give a talk on the Ark Park at a special session at the Geological Society of America national meeting in Denver late last month.   Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the meeting because I had used a number of vacation days on my recent trip to Svalbard, Norway.   Therefore, I teamed up with Dr. Kent Ratajeski, a geologist and (evangelical Christian) from the University of Kentucky Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. He presented the Ark talk at GSA and put together on the attached YouTube video after he returned from the meeting. Although I am not religious, it was great to work with Drs. Ratajeski and \[Joel\] Duff on alerting the geological community about the remarkable non-science and anti-science being promoted with the aid of tax incentives here in Kentucky. It is very important to work with members of the religious community that are aghast at what Ken Ham and his fellow young earth creationists do to misrepresent not only science, but also religion.  The attached YouTube video is Dr. Ratajeski reading his talk and showing the PowerPoint slides.  This isn't him at the meeting itself, since rules prohibit GSA talks from being recorded at meetings.
