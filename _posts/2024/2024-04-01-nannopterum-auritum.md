<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Double-crested_Cormorant/overview"><i>Nannopterum auritum</i></a> â€“ double-crested cormorant, Wally Toevs Pond, Boulder, Colorado, March, 2024. The photographer writes: "Not my best picture ever, but it shows the double crests exceedingly well. According to All about Birds, the crests are seen on adults only during the breeding season, by which they presumably mean both sexes." He adds, "Never backlight a black bird (on that cloudy day, unfortunately every direction on the pond was backlighted)," and he thanks Photonix, the god of photography, for enabling image processing.
