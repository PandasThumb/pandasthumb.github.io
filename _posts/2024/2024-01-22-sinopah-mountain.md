<figcaption> Morning reflections of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinopah_Mountain">Sinopah Mountain</a> (8,271 ft) and Paradise Point, eastern shore of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Medicine_Lake"> Two Medicine Lake</a>, Glacier National Park, Montana. Also visible on horizon (L-R) are Painted Teepee (7,850 ft); Two Medicine Pass, Sinopah Mountain, Mt. Helen (8,538 ft) and Dawson Pass. The purple/maroon tints of these mountains are colored by mudstones and argillites in the Appekunny and Grinnell Formations (Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup, ~1.4 Ga). These formations are also a portion of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Overthrust">Lewis Overthrust</a> structure of the Rocky Mountain front range in Northern Montana.
