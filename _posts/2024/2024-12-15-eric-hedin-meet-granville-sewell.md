Physicist Eric Hedin has posted to the Discovery Institute site 
[Evolution News on 27 November 2024](https://evolutionnews.org/2024/11/theres-a-limit-to-what-nature-can-do/) an argument that the processes of physics cannot 
account for intelligent life.  As he is a well-trained physicist (whose Ph.D. 
degree was from my university), and who has done experimental 
work on plasma physics, we can expect a mathematically sophisticated 
argument which would give us all pause.

Well, here's the guts of his argument, from the Evolution News post: 

> In fact, for making anything other than large-scale conglomerations of matter (such as stars and planets), nature has only one tool in its bag — the electromagnetic force. This tool primarily manifests as the electric force, causing opposite charges (such as electrons and protons) to attract, and like charges to repel. It is completely indiscriminate, and cannot select between multiple options, preferring one charge over another, except for the rule that the bigger the charges and the closer the distance between them the stronger the resulting force. Can you imagine such blind, brute forces pulling together countless atoms of specific elements into the necessary configurations to result in a functioning laptop computer?

and

> The “boundaries of science” refers to the common-sense conclusion that nature is limited in what it can produce to outcomes consistent with the laws and forces of nature. Natural processes are sought and found to be sufficient for natural phenomena, such as star formation or precipitation. 
>
> However, attempting to naturally explain the origin of some things found within our universe comes into conflict with the boundaries of science. Positing a natural explanation for the origin of the universe itself, the origin of the specific suite of physical parameters finely tuned to allow life, the origin of life itself, and the origin of conscious, intelligent minds, all defy what we have discovered about the limits of natural processes.

And basically, that's the argument.  Evolutionary biology does not pretend to address the origin of the universe, or the issue of fine-tuning in physics, and even the origin of life is outside its scope, though adjacent.  But somehow Hedin knows that physical forces cannot explain "the origin of conscious, 
intelligent minds".   I wonder how he knows that.

## Meet Granville Sewell ##

Hedin's argument is quite similar to Granville Sewell's. Sewell asks (rhetorically) whether it is not implausible that advanced technology such as iPhones could have resulted from natural forces, which involve only random collisions of particles.   An example of his argument will be found [here](https://evolutionnews.org/2021/04/some-problems-can-be-proved-unsolvable/), where he asks it is possible to 
>Explain how life could have originated and evolved into intelligent humans, through entirely natural (unintelligent) processes.

Granville Sewell is a mathematician, who is Emeritus Professor at the University of Texas at El Paso.  He is a specialist in differential equations. Here is how he invokes physics to solve this problem:

> Well, I have a very simple proof that the biological problem #3  \[the one mentioned above\] posed above is also impossible to solve, that does fit in the margin of this document. All one needs to do is realize that if a solution were found, we would have proved something obviously false, that a few (four, apparently) fundamental, unintelligent forces of physics alone could have rearranged the fundamental particles of physics into libraries full of science texts and encyclopedias, computers connected to monitors, keyboards, laser printers and the Internet, cars, trucks, airplanes, nuclear power plants and Apple iPhones.

These are from a 2021 post at Evolution News (which I linked is above). It should be obvious that these two arguments are similar, since they invoke physics.  They also lack mathematical details.
