<figcaption><a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/red-shouldered-hawk"><i>Buteo lineatus</i></a> &ndash; red-shouldered hawk, observed in back yard, Durham, NC, December, 2014. Mr. Lundin writes, "I like this one for the angle of view (slightly downward), and the background coloration that matches the hawk's coloration. This hawk was undoubtedly preying on the colony of rabbits inhabiting the brush in my back yard."
