<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatoda"><i>Steatoda</i> sp.</a> â€“ false black widow spider with egg sac, Boulder, Colorado, June, 2024. <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/6926">Bugguide lists several species</a> that are found here in Colorado, sometimes without pictures. If anyone can identify the species, I will gladly modify the post, besides of course giving you credit. I will also keep an eye on the egg sac and notify you if my porch becomes crawling with spiders.
