<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_ivy"><i>Toxicodendron</i> sp.</a>, judging by a range map <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_radicans">here</a>, probably <i>T. rydbergii</i> &ndash; poison ivy. As I was taking the picture, someone came by and announced, "Berries white, run in fright," which is pretty good advice. For a picture of poison ivy leaves with their characteristic mitten shape, see <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/11/toxicodendron-r1.html">here</a>. The leaves may be <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/12/toxicodendron-ry.html">red in the fall</a>; but they are not always red.
