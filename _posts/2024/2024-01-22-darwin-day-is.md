Darwin Day, that is, the anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth in 1809, is February 12. If you are sponsoring any Darwin Day events, or indeed if you know of any, please submit them to <a href="https://darwinday.org/">International Darwin Day</a>. As I write, only a half-dozen events are listed, and I am sure that there are many more.
