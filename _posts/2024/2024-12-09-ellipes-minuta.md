<figcaption><i><a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/110363">Ellipes minuta</a></i> &ndash; pygmy mole cricket.  Dr. Sturtevant notes, "This insect is a small oddity. Despite its name, the diminutive pygmy mole crickets are not true mole crickets, or even crickets for that matter. They are classified as belonging in the same sub-order as grasshoppers."
