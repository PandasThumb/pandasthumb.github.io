Merry Kitzmas to all!  Today is the 19th anniversary of the <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</i> trial, aka the Dover Panda Trial, held from September-November 2005, and decided on December 20, 2005. 

Next year, 2025, will be the 20th anniversary of Kitzmiller, as well as the 100th anniversary of <i>Tennessee v. Scopes</i>, aka the Scopes Monkey Trial.

Stuck as I am, in Australia/New Zealand with 3 little kids, I expect I will have to follow events from afar.  But I will use this thread to accumulate links & dates for relevant events as they come up. And please contribute ones you come across!

I expect that many are glum about current politics and science, but I recall a similar feeling in 2004, and that <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> was one of the early signs that committed citizens could move events in a pro-science direction. May 2025 be another such time!
