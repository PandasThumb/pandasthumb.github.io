I have been reading the new 2nd edition of <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em> and wanted 
to give some reactions to it, having reached the end of the chapter on "Specified 
Complexity".  This new edition adds Winston Ewert as the second author.  Unlike the 
1998 first edition, which was published by Cambridge University Press, this "Revised 
and Expanded" 25th anniversary 2nd edition is published by Discovery Institute Press.  For 
a book of 582 pages, it is available 
rather inexpensively, in a paperback edition and in a 
Kindle edition.  (Its cover illustration shows the faces on Mount Rushmore, as an 
example of a design inference).

William Dembski's original Design Inference argument involved our seeing a 
pattern in nature, in an organism, that embodied what he called Specified 
Complexity.  Its argument became better known as a result of Dembski's 2002 
book <em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot be Purchased Without Intelligence".</em> 
This was much invoked as a major argument for Intelligent Design at the time of the 2005 Kitzmiller vs. Dover School Board trial.

The Specified Complexity argument involves genotypes arrayed 
on a scale.  A scale of what, we will be discussing.  The general strategy of the design inference 
is to find a region of the scale that is so improbable under "chance" that natural processes would be extremely unlikely to result in genotypes that good or better.  The probabilities that natural processes would produce anything that good have to be so small that such an event would be 
expected less than once in the whole history of the Universe.

Over the years since 1998, there seem to have been several definitions of the scale:

1. A quantity which is fitness or a component of fitness, with the probability being simply
   the fraction of all genotypes having that high, or higher a value in the initial population.  Or,
2. The same scale, but with the probability being instead the chance that natural evolutionary processes
   would produce that good a value, or higher, or
3. A more mysterious scale involving whether the genotype (or phenotype) could be produced by a small set of instructions.

The first one is related to a concept called Functional Information.  As I will show, the second is not at all useful.  The interesting new development is that Dembski and Ewert have moved to definition 3, resulting in a specification that no longer has any connection to Functional Information.

We'll discuss these one at a time ...

1. In the original 1998 edition of <em>The Design Inference</em> William Dembski did not discuss using the design inference on genotypes that were argued to have arisen by natural selection and other ordinary evolutionary propcesses (in section 2.3 he gives a "case study" of the "Creation-evolution controversy" but focuses that entirely on the origin of Life, not on evolution thereafter).  Four years later, he applied his inference to biological evolution in his work <em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot be Purchased without Intelligence</em>. There he gave examples of the specification scales of interest in discussions of evolution:

> The specification of organisms can be cashed out in any number of ways. Arno Wouters cashes it out globally in terms of the <em>viability</em> of whole orgamisms. Michael Behe cashes it out in terms of the <em>minimal function</em> of  biochemical systems. Darwinist Richard Dawkins cashes out biological specification in terms of the <em>reproduction</em> of genes.  Thus, in <em>The Blind Watchmaker</em> Dawkins writes "Complicated things have some quality, specifiable in advance, that is highly unlikely to have been acquired by random chance alone.  In the case of living systems, the quality that is specified in advance is ... the ability to propagate genes in reproduction." (Dembski, <em>No Free Lunch</em>, 2002 and 2007, p. 148).

## Functional Information ##

This was originally defined by Leslie Orgel in 1973.  He was trying to definea measure of information that was useful to the organism. ruling out aspects of its phenotype that might require lots of elaborate description, but the details of which did not particularly help the organism.  The concept was made more precise by Jack Szostak in a papper in _Nature_ in 2003, with a small modification by Haxen, Carothers, Griffin, and Szostak in 2007.

Improbable on a scale (what?)
Improbable that one that good would occur even once in the history of the universe.
What is scale of "goodness"?  Adaptation? Fitness?
Something that evolution achieves?

KIRK DURSTON QUOTE:
A unique signature of intelligence

Design detection is firmly entrenched in science, including forensic science, defence research, SETI, archeology, and biology. In each area, a variety of methods are used, but the core aspect of all of them can be quantified in terms of functional information (defined in the literature by Szostak (1), Hazen et al., (2), and Durston et al. (3)). In layperson’s terms, functional information is the information required to produce a desired effect. A testable, verifiable, and falsifiable hypothesis that is highly useful to design detection can be stated as follows:

Hypothesis: A unique property of intelligent minds is the ability to produce statistically significant levels of functional information as defined in the literature.

A key word here is “unique”; intelligence is the only thing with enough intellectual horsepower to produce significant levels of functional information. The above hypothesis is certainly testable and falsifiable. To falsify it, all we need is to verify a natural, mindless process that will produce statistically significant levels of functional information. 
... the only option science has on the table that is observable, testable, and verified is intelligence
Almost anything, including dumping alphabet characters out of a box on to the floor, can produce functional information at trivial or non-significant levels. However, if one wishes to produce significant levels of functional information one needs something else in addition. Right now, the only option science has on the table that is observable, testable, and verified is intelligence. Although there are other creative scenarios as to how large quantities of functional information can be formed naturally, our failure to verify them suggests that they should be more properly classified as science fiction. (4)

A scientific method for Design Detection

The hypothesis stated above provides the basis for a scientific method to test any effect to see if it required intelligence to produce.

Step One: Evaluate the level of functional information required to produce the effect

Step Two: Determine if the level of functional information is statistically significant

Step Three: If it is statistically significant, then we can infer that intelligence was required to produce the effect

Is this a “god-of-the-gaps” argument?

Oddly, I have people confidently assert that I have presented a “god-of-the-gaps” argument, which clearly it is not. A “god-of-the-gaps” argument always contains the following premise, either explicit or assumed …

“god-of-the-gaps” premise: If we don’t know what produced “X”, then God did it.

The scientific method I presented above is obviously devoid of such a premise. We actually know what can produce functional information—intelligence. It is an observable fact. We do it all the time whenever we send a text, write an essay, or build something. It is the only empirically verified option that science has today; other scenarios still remain in the category of unverified science fiction. Functional information is a positive indicator or ‘fingerprint’ of an intelligent mind.

2nd PDZ Domain by Kirk Durston using MacPyMol
2nd PDZ Domain by Kirk Durston using MacPyMol

My first step was to develop and publish a method to estimate the level of functional information required to code for protein families—an essential requirement for life. (3) Applying that method to a multiple sequence alignment consisting of 30,176 sequences for the second PDZ domain (5) reveals that this protein domain requires at least 140 bits of functional information. To understand how significant that is, the probability that natural processes could generate that level of functional information is 1 chance in 10 with 41 zeros after it. Recent work by other scientists on the PDZ domain indicates that my method is quite conservative, but a conservative estimate is more preferable than an overestimate, since I wish to avoid false positives (having the digital information for a protein test positive for intelligent design when it might not be the case).  

Implications

The above example was for a protein domain only one third the length of an average protein. Using that result as a ballpark estimate, an average protein-coding gene will require very roughly 420 bits of functional information and even the simplest bacteria require hundreds of different genes.

Conclusion: 

The positive markers (fingerprints) of an intelligent mind are all over the genomes of life. Life tests positive for intelligent design utilizing the scientific method outlined above. We can conclude, therefore, that the fingerprints of intelligence are all over the DNA of life.

Additional Reading:

For a fascinating summary of how well science is doing in attempting to answer the origin of life question, I recommend this brief article by James Tour, internationally distinguished synthetic organic chemist, ‘Time Out’.

For an excellent book relating to this subject, read Stephen C. Meyer’s, Darwin’s Doubt.

The new argument (ASC)
   ASC = CSI =  length - program length
   "chance" defined as everything else beside design
   no notion of "goodness = degree of adaptation"
   An example of CSI by natural causes: phyllotaxis (auxins)

How is Dembski going to use this to refute the improvement of 
adaptation by natural evolutionary processes?
