According to a headline in the Washington Post, <a href="https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3ddacd0/665719e273e72c3ea1cffc06/596a8aedae7e8a0ef33f6950/3/13/665719e273e72c3ea1cffc06">Giant pandas are returning to D.C. this year, the Smithsonianâ€™s National Zoo announces, after reaching a lease agreement with China</a>. The two pandas, a two-year-old male named Bao Li and a two-year-old female named Qing Bao, are due to arrive later in the year. Bao Li's mother is Bao Bao, a giant panda who was born at the zoo in 2013. Both are of course relatives of Prof. Steve Steve, the mascot of The Panda's Thumb. Prof. Steve Steve is impressed that his relatives will cost the zoo $1 million per year for 10 years.
