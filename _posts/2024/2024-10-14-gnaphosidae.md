I found this spider trapped in a porcelain sink from which it could not climb out, so I naturally snapped a few pictures. The people at <a href="https://bugguide.net">Bugguide</a> classified it as a member of the family Gnaphosidae. They warned me that Google Lens is not good at spiders, but, just for fun, I asked. Among the first hits was my very own picture of this very spider <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/2379696">here</a>.
