<figcaption>Morning dew on an unidentified leaf, Ganges, Saltspring Island, B.C. Canon 40D, 100&nbsp;mm macro. Mr. Phelps writes: "Vancouver Island is temperate rainforest. Our property is mostly a sharp, rocky ridge with a couple micro-climates. Standard issue fir trees, ferns, etc. on the north side, and a bit more of a Southern Oregon feel on the top of the ridge, with some pines and lots of Arbutus. Very hot in summer with all the rock." He adds that since taking the photo some years ago, he has learned that the droplets might be due to transpiration rather than dew. He further adds parenthetically that Capt Stormfield is a "name adopted from Mark Twain's short story '<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1044/1044-h/1044-h.htm">Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven</a>.' Reading this at the age of 14 &ndash; despite the disapproval of the teacher at the [Seventh Day Adventist] church school I was attending &ndash; is my first recollection of the awakening skepticism that led me out of fundamentalism by my undergrad years."
