When evolutionary biologists argue with creationists or 
advocates of Intelligent Design about the effectiveness 
of natural selection, the biologists often use the example of 
artificial selection.  And almost invariably, the 
ID advocate or creationist tries for a "gotcha" by 
saying "but artificial selection is an example of 
intelligent design, and is nothing like natural 
selection!"

We're going to go into why this is not a "gotcha" 
but is a mistaken analogy on their part.

Artificial selection is a very old practice, dating 
back to inadvertent selection when wild animals wwere 
domesticated, with the wildest ones being eaten or chased 
away, or they successfully escaped.  With the start of 
agriculture, farmers often bred from their best animals 
(or plants).   Charles Darwin paid close attention to 
the ways animals had been changed by breeding, both for 
food production or as pets.  He was particularly attentive 
to the reesults of pigeon breeding. "Natural selection" was named 
in analogy to artificial selection.

## How much design is in Design? ##

Saying that artificial selection is Intelligent Design is 
wrong because plant and animal breeders, until very recently, 
had no detailed understanding of the genomes of their 
organisms or how to make detailed changes in the genomes to 
affect the phenotype.  All they could do was to choose who 
to breed from, based on their phenotype (such as the amount 
of beef produced).

In the 20th century this got more sophisticated, but was still 
not Intelligent Design.  Real statisticians got involved, and 
selection was based on statistical indices from multiple 
characters.  I remember visiting a poultry breeding operation 
and hearing how they measured 10 characters, including not 
just the production characters but such important traits as 
susceptibility to viral disease.  This was in the 1970s, and 
they had a modest mainfram computer in their offices, with 
databases of traits.  It was the natural outcome of work in 
the 1930s and 1940s by quantitative-genetics-inspired animal 
breeders at such centers as Iowa State University.

But they did not know the detailed genetics of these traits. 
The selection still depended on observing the traits and not 
directly knowing any of the genetics, or much about the 
developmental biology of the traits.

## On to Intelligent Design ##

By the 2010s animal and plant breeding was entering a new 
era, though with difficulty.  In 2014 I was invited to give 
a talk (on natural selection) in Vancouver BC, at the 10th World 
Congress of Genetics Applied to Livestock Production.  I was 
talking about the mathematics of natural selection.  It was 
apparent from the muted audience response that this was now of lesser 
interest to people working on livestock production.

Instead the hot topic of the Congress was QTLs -- "quantitive trait 
loci" -- how could they find individual genes whose alleles 
affected the production traits and disease resistance traits. 
If these could be found, they could be used by screening potential 
parents of the next generation, and maybe even by genetically 
engineering their genotypes.

The fact that lots of effort is now going on towards 
entering this new era of genomics should be enough to make it clear 
that even thousands of years of animal and plant breeding, 
with lots of human intelligence applied, is not the same as 
Intelligent Design.   So the success of that history of breeding does 
say a lot about it as exemplifying the power of selection, 
without genetic engineering or even understanding the effects 
of changes in genotypes.

## A comparable example ##

It occurs to me that another similar flawed critique is 
when creationists and ID advocates argue that the success 
of Genetic Algorithms in solving engineering problems is 
irrelevant, because that is an example of Intelligent 
Design.  It isn't, if the algorithm has random mutations, 
random recombinations, and random mating, with fitnesses based 
on the final phenotypes rather than on detailed knowledge 
of how they were achieved.

In ID books such as Robert Marks, William Dembski, and 
Winston Ewert's "Introduction to Evolutionary Informatics" there 
is a great effort to show that in simulations of 
natural selection, they only succeed because the design 
information is built in.  For example, in Richard Dawkins's 
famous teaching example of the "Weasel", the target phrase 
is part of the program.

Yet in other cases, such as Dave Thomas's genetic algorithm 
for a Traveling Salesman problem (see [his 2006 post here at 
Panda's Thumb](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/target-target-w-1.html)
) no particular solution is built in.  All Marks, Dembski and 
Ewert could do was point to places where some fine-tuning of 
the algorithm had been made to make it more successful, but 
this is not the same as building in the answer to the particular 
problem.

So neither the success of animal and plant breeding, nor 
the success of genetic algorithms, can be sensibly attributed 
to Intelligent Design of the answers.
