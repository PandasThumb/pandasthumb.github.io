Since at least May, 2024, the Creation Museum and Ken Ham have been discussing a new display, meant to describe the dinosaur _Protoceratops_ being drowned in the Biblical Flood of Noah (see for example [https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/](https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/) and <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/">https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/</a>). This display finally opened in late October, 2024. Figure 1 is the original mock-up of this ridiculous display from Ken Ham&rsquo;s blog. Pictures of the display are available on several Answers in Genesis&rsquo; and Ken Ham&rsquo;s social media pages. Long (2024) describes the artwork going into this new display. Although the artwork depicting the dinosaur itself is excellent, the display has absurd, inaccurate, misleading, and dishonest information on the depositional environment of the surrounding sediment and the taphonomy of _Protoceratops_ and other Cretaceous vertebrate fossils of Mongolia.

The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, both owned by the Young Earth Creationistministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), espouse that the fossil record is a result of Noah&rsquo;s Flood which occurred in 2348 BC. All employees of AiG must sign off on a &ldquo;Statement of Faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/">https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/</a>), that states in part:

>The great flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and catastrophic in its effects. At one stage during the flood, the waters covered the entire surface of the whole globe with no land surface being exposed anywhere&mdash;the flood of Noah is not to be understood as any form of local or regional flood. The Noachian flood was a significant geological event, and most fossiliferous sediments were deposited at that time (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%207.19%E2%80%9320">Genesis 7:19&ndash;20</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Pet%203.5%E2%80%937">2 Peter 3:5&ndash;7</a>).

And further:

>No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/whats-the-best-proof-of-creation/">evidence is always subject to interpretation</a> by fallible people who do not possess all information (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Num%2023.19">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Sam%2022.31">2 Samuel 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2018.30">Psalm 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2046.9%E2%80%9310">Isaiah 46:9&ndash;10</a>, <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isaiah%2055.9">55:9</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%203.4">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Tim%203.16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).

Of course this ends any attempt at science by AiG employees and replaces geology, paleontology, and all other science and history with unchanging religious dogma.

Because of their weird dogma, AiG has an unusual take on dinosaurs and other prehistoric life forms. Both the Ark and Creation Museum have problematic displays on dinosaurs. In dioramas, dinosaurs are depicted as living with people, among ancient buildings, in stalls on Noah&rsquo;s Ark, and most amazingly, fighting with humans and giants in a pre-Flood arena of death (see Figure 3 below). The Creation Museum has a actual skeleton of the dinosaur _Allosaurus_ on display that was donated by white nationalist and neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka (see: <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/">https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/</a>). This _Allosaurus_ skeleton is depicted as drowning in Noah&rsquo;s Flood in 2348 BC.

Answers in Genesis original dinosaur modeler and country singer, the recently deceased Buddy Davis, even has a children&rsquo;s song that cultishly is meant to repeat Ken Ham&rsquo;s catchphrase dogma that the fossil record is &ldquo;Billions of dead things, buried in rock layers, laid down by water, all over the earth.&rdquo; Davis gets children to repeat this again and again to music, a very effective indoctrination technique. The song can be heard in part here <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/media/audio/audio-archives/billions-dead-things-sample/">https://answersingenesis.org/media/audio/audio-archives/billions-dead-things-sample/</a> (Davis, ND).

The new _Protoceratops_ display continues this stream of indoctrination and misinformation.

## _Protoceratops_ ##

_Protoceratops_ is one of the most studied dinosaurs in the history of vertebrate paleontology. The peer-reviewed scientific literature on this dinosaur, the depositional environment of the surrounding sediments, and aspects of the dinosaur&rsquo;s taphonomy (the study of how organisms decay and are fossilized) is simply enormous and only a fraction can be cited in this simple blog post. Surprisingly, Wikipedia has an excellent page describing _Protoceratops_&lsquo;s physical characteristics, discovery, paleoecology, and various aspects of the dinosaur&rsquo;s biology, as well as citations of the primary sources. Good accounts of basic information about the dinosaur can also be found in Dodson (1996); Prothero (2019); and Fastovsky and Weishampel (2016).

The ceratopsian _Protoceratops_ was a fairly small ornithischian dinosaur with complete growth sequences from very small juvenile specimens to adults about 2.5 meters long being known. Maximum body weight was slightly above 100 kg. Adults were quadrupeds, but juveniles may have been capable of walking as bipeds. The skull has a fairly large frill, and the nose of _Protoceratops_ has a horn-like structure that doesn&rsquo;t stand out as much as in other Ceratopsid dinosaurs. The teeth indicate the animal was a vegetarian, shearing off vegetation with the aid of a very sharp beak (a characteristic of many ornithischians). _Protoceratops_ had relatively large eyes (even the sclerotic ring is known) and strong limbs, suggesting it was well-adapted to dim light, and capable of burrowing, although burrowing is not certain. The _Protoceratops_ from Mongolia are a single species _P. andrewsi_, while another, slightly larger species _P. hellenikorhinus_ is known from similar deposits in China. There are likely to be other species of _Protoceratops_, and the dinosaur _Bainoceratops_ may be a synonym or a very close relative. All members of the Family Protoceratopsidae are Late Cretaceous (Campanian) in age, which is approximately 75 to 71 million years old (Dingus _et al_., 2008).

_Protoceratops_ was discovered in 1923 by scientists working for the American Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s Third Central Asiatic Expedition to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia (for historical accounts see: Andrews, 1926; Andrews _et al_., 1932; Colbert, 1968 and 2000; Gallenkamp, 2001; and Sullivan, _et al._, 2012) and formally described by Granger and Gregory (1923). After WWII, the Soviets, and still later Polish researchers did geological and paleontological research in this part of the Gobi. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, Japanese, Canadian, American (once again mostly from the American Museum of Natural History), and scientists from many other nations studied the Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of the Gobi (Colbert, 1968, 2000; and Sullivan _et al_. 2012). Note that for all their posing as scientists, creationists haven&rsquo;t actually contributed <strong>_anything_</strong> to this scientific exploration and original research.

## Cretaceous of Mongolia ##

The _Protoceratops_ specimens from Mongolia are found in the Late Cretaceous Djadochta (sometimes spelled Djadokata or Djadokhta) Formation. The Djadochta is primarily a reddish colored fine- to medium-grained well-sorted quartz sandstone. There are minor amounts of conglomerates, siltstones, and calcareous nodule layers to be found in the unit. Regionally, the Djadochta is approximately 90 m (~300 feet) thick. Many of the beds are cross-bedded, but some are massive and do not show apparent sedimentary structures. Good descriptions, including stratigraphic columns, of the unit, can be found in Dingus and Loope (2000); Dingus _et al_. (2008); Fastovsky _et a_l. (1997); Jerzykiewicz (1997 and 2000); Jerzykiewicz and Russell (1991); Jerzykiewicz _et al_. (1993); Loope _et al. _(1998); Loope _et al_. (1999); and Shuvalov (2000). Wikipedia also has a very general description of the unit and cites some of the primary literature.

The new display at the Creation Museum is rather short on describing the Djadochta Formation. It literally cartoonishly contrasts the &ldquo;Naturalistic Evolutionist&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Biblical Creationist&rdquo; interpretation with actual cartoons depicting the burial of _Protoceratops_. The display simplistically claims &ldquo;Naturalistic Evolutionists&rdquo; think that _Protoceratops_ was buried by eolian (wind-driven) dunes during sandstorms, while they claim the dinosaurs were drowned and buried by underwater sandslides, driven by currents, during Noah&rsquo;s Flood. The Creation Museum display only presents a tiny amount of selective evidence for their view, then declares victory over the &ldquo;Naturalistic Evolutionists.&rdquo; A September 29, 2024 &ldquo;X&rdquo; (formerly Twitter) post by Ken Ham includes a photo of part of the display. The main portion of the signage reads:

> <strong>DUNES OF DEATH</strong>
>
> WATER OR WIND?
>
> The circumstances surrounding the burial of fossilized animals at Ukhaa Tolgod in Mongolia help show the differences between observational and historical science and how worldviews shape one&rsquo;s conclusions.
>
> THE SAME EVIDENCE
>
> Creationists and evolutionists observe the same bones and agree that they are buried in ancient sand dunes, which can be formed by wind or flowing water. Proponents of either perspective can see that the dune cross-beds (remnants of sand avalanches) have 25&deg; slope angles. All agree that the fossilization of the bones occurred when waterborne minerals seeped in and replaced the organic material. But while creationists and evolutionists use the same scientific evidence, they frequently interpret the evidence in different ways.
>
> ANALYSIS
>
> Both interpretations are based on the same evidence, but only one explains all the available data. Wind-formed dunes often have 28 - 34&deg; downwind slope angles, whereas these slopes at Ukhaa Tolgod measure 25&deg;- an angle more typical of water-formed dunes. Also, the sandstone encasing the animals is saturated with the waterborne mineral calcium carbonate. Ultimately, the evidence is more reasonably explained by biblical creation model.&rdquo;


Additional text in the display includes a tear-jerking narrative about the poor _Protoceratops_ escaping by swimming in the early weeks of Noah&rsquo;s Flood, only to face burial in a sand slide in &ldquo;a water-formed dune.&rdquo;

The actual depositional environments of the Djadochta Formation are much more complex than the above creationist fantasy. While the Djadochta is considered to be primarily eolian sands, there is evidence of a complex facies mosaic that also includes alluvial fan deposition, fluvial deposits in the form of short-lived streams, as well as minor areas with lacustrine (lake) deposition (see: Dingus and Loope, 2000; Dingus _et al._, 2008; Jerzykiewicz, 1997 and 2000; Jerzykiewicz and Russell, 1991; Jerzykiewicz et al., 1993; Loope _et al.,_ 1998 and Loope _et al_., 1999; and Novacek _et al_., 1994). Besides the well-sorted cross-bedded sandstone, other evidence for the rock being deposited in a semi-arid desert environment comes from the presence of caliche deposits that probably represent paleosols, and vertical traces that represent numerous invertebrate burrows. Loope _et al_. (1998) illustrate the cross-bedding, carbonate nodules, and probable dinosaur tracks in the sandstone in their figure 3. Several examples of burrows and rhizoliths (fossil plant roots) are illustrated in Jerzykiewicz _et al_. (1993).

Many of the vertebrate fossil bearing layers lack any discernible sedimentary structures other than caliche layers that contain rhizoliths. These units are have been described as &ldquo;structureless sands.&rdquo; Dingus and Loope (2000) and Dingus _et al_. (2008) interpret these &ldquo;structureless sands&rdquo; as dune-derived sand-slides from times of lessened aridity/increased humidity (mesic conditions). Some of the evidence for times of increased humidity is described by Dingus and Loope (2008), who document crayfish-like burrows that represent unknown arthropods that dug down through the dry sands to reach groundwater. During these relatively-humid &ldquo;mesic&rdquo; times, dunes were held in place by caliche paleosols and vegetation, only to become oversteepened and eventually suddenly collapse, burying _Protoceratops, _other dinosaurs_, _and other vertebrates of the Djadochta.

A number of features characterize eolian deposits in the rock record, but no single criterion characterizes _all_ eolian rocks. Eolian depositional environments can be incredibly complex and not easily characterized be cartoonish diagrams. The Creation Museum signage claiming the cross-bedding has the exact slope angle of 25&deg; in the Djadokata Formation at Ukhaa Tolgod as being significant is simply not correct. In reality, ancient dune deposits can display very shallow to extremely steep cross-bedding angles. In many cases the angle is due to the moisture content and composition of the sand. For example, dry, well-sorted sand tends to pile up at maximum angles of 30 to 34&deg; (Hill and Moshier, 2016), while slightly more moisture from various causes can result in angles above 40&deg; (Bigarella, 1974). However, when sands become saturated with water, they can not maintain a steep slope and collapse. Hill and Moshier remind their readers that have built sandcastles at a beach of this property of moisture-rich sand. Moreover, very shallow slopes are also possible near the base of the downwind side of dunes (Bigarella, 1974). Thus, although eolian dunes tend to have steeper maximum cross-bedding compared to sand deposits formed under water, the exact angle alone doesn&rsquo;t differentiate them from underwater sandbars. Ahlbrandt and Fryberger (1982) beautifully illustrate a number of eolian deposits and discuss additional criteria for the recognition of eolianites. These include the mineralogy, sorting, and tabular nature of the deposits themselves, combined with numerous sedimentary structures besides cross-bedding. In their detailed study of the Djadochta Formation, Dingus _et al_. (2008) also note many of the features discussed above, including calcareous paleosols, trace fossils in the form of dinosaur tracks, invertebrate burrows, and rhizoliths (fossil plant roots). Niedzwiedzki, _et al._, (2012) note a track beneath a _Protoceratops_ skeleton. Dingus _et al_. (2008) also note that the Djadochta is a mosaic of several facies, including dune deposits, siltstone interdune deposits, conglomerates that had their source in outwash from alluvial fans, and sandslide deposits from dunes that occasionally collapsed after a period of stability. Interspersed with this were small lakes or ponds that accumulated silty muds and sands. Interestingly, the Creation Museum signage mentions the presence of the mineral calcite (CaCOâ‚ƒ) as if it were indicative of a marine deposit, whereas the mineral is also often associated with the caliches and paleosols that form in arid desert environments.

So, what is the source for the creationist misinformation on the Djadochta Formation? I have only been able to find two discussions in the creationist literature, both by AiG geologist, Dr. Andrew Snelling (1998 and 2009).

In Snelling (1998), he discusses unnamed creationists considering the possibility of the Djadochta Formation being post-Flood; as silly as this is, it would be a convenient way to accept the overwhelming evidence for eolian deposition. Snelling (2008) also represents Loope _et al_. (1998) as somehow denying eolian deposits because of their proposal that the structureless sands were the result of sandslides that occurred suddenly during more humid (mesic) conditions. Snelling tries very hard to imply to his readers that since rainfall/water is involved, the rocks and fossils are somehow consistent with Flood geology. Putting the short review paper by Snelling side by side with the research by Loope _et al_. (1998) just doesn&rsquo;t jive. To be charitable, perhaps Dr. Snelling didn&rsquo;t understand the conclusions of Loope _et al_. (1998).

Snelling (2009, pp. 547 - 549) appears to be the source of a lot of the misinformation on the Creation Museum&rsquo;s signage associated with the _Protoceratops_ display. The signage and Snelling use almost identical language when discussing the cross-bedding slope angles. Lang (2024) discusses the artwork and signage of the new exhibit; one can conclude that the exhibit designer&rsquo;s used Snelling (2009) as their major inspiration.

The study of ancient eolian deposits ends up having important economic benefits. Several eolian deposits in the Western United States and the North Sea produce oil and natural gas from porous and permeable eolian sediments. Additionally, groundwater is known to deposit of uranium and other economic minerals in eolian sedimentary rocks ( Ahlbrandt and Fryberger, 1982; Galloway and Hobday, 1983). Thus there are economic considerations in studying ancient eolian deposits, not just academic questions concerning earth history.

## Taphonomy of _Protoceratops_ ##

There is also an enormous literature on the taphonomy (the study of the death and postmortem history of an organism to fossilization) of the _Protoceratops_ specimens from the Djadochta Formation. Fastovsky _et al_. (1997) is the major study, but much information can be gleaned from other sources. Protoceratops is commonly found completely or mostly articulated and are usually oriented parallel to the direction of crossbedding dip. Often the limbs are contracted and the necks pulled back (this death pose may be evidence for desiccation). However, Fastovsky _et al_. (1997) think that death often occurred via suffocation during sand storms. In contrast, the work of Loope _et al_. (1998); Loope _et al_. (1999); Dingus and Loope (2000) and Dingus _et al_. (2008) suggest sudden burial by the collapsing dunes as discussed above. Jerzykiewicz _et al_. (1993, Figure 12) illustrate a complete _Protoceratops_ skeleton in a near-standing position, as if it died while struggling to escape the surrounding sediment. Hone _et al_. (2014) document several juvenile _Protoceratops_ that also represent death by burial in sand storms or dune collapses.

Perhaps the most famous Djadochta Formation fossil is a specimen found by the Polish-Mongolian expedition of 1971. This amazing fossil is of a _Velociraptor_ associated, perhaps during interspecific combat, with a _Protoceratops_. This is illustrated in Jerzykiewicz _et al_. (1993, Figure 11). Barsbold (2016) defends the idea that these dinosaurs were rapidly buried in the act of the _Velociraptor_ attacking the _Protoceratops_. While scenarios where the fighting dinosaurs were buried during a dune collapse or sandstorm seem plausible, sudden burial of both animals together underwater does not.

## Other Vertebrate Fossils ##

Besides _Protoceratops, _there are numerous other dinosaurs and terrestrial vertebrates to be found in the Djadochta Formation (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadochta_Formation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadochta_Formation</a> for a list). Especially important non-dinosaur fossils are the Mesozoic mammals discussed in Kieran-Jaworowska (2013) and elsewhere.

## Dinosaur Nests ##

One of the major discoveries of American Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s Third Central Asiatic Expedition were the first recognized examples of dinosaur eggs and nests. These were first misinterpreted as being from the dinosaur _Protoceratops_, although the bones of another dinosaur were often found with the nests. This other dinosaur received the name _Oviraptor_ (egg thief) because of the association, in the mistaken interpretation that it was stealing and eating _Protoceratops_ eggs. It was not until discoveries by scientists working for the American Museum of Natural History in the 1990s that it was determined that these are oviraptor eggs and nests (for popular accounts, see: Clark,1995; Mikhailov, _et al_., 1994; Zelenitsky, _et al_., 2012); and a well-illustrated juvenile book by Norell and Dingus, 1999). Besides _Oviraptor_, a more common oviraptoid named _Citipati_ is known from numerous Djadochta Formation specimens, including several that are fossilized brooding on their nests (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati</a>)). These are scientifically documented in Norell _et al_., 1995; Clark, 1995; and Norell _et al_., 2018. The most famous of these oviraptors of the genus _Citipai_ brooding on its nest is known as the &ldquo;Big Mamma&rdquo; specimen and is on display at the American Museum of Natural History (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati#/media/File:Citipati_AMNH.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citipati#/media/File:Citipati_AMNH.jpg</a> for a copyright-free photograph). It is difficult to imagine how these oviraptors could have been building nests, laying eggs, then brooding over them in underwater sandslides, as the creationists are bizarrely suggesting. A terrestrial lifestyle and environment of deposition, whether burial in sandstorms or catastrophic collapse of eolian dunes, are reasonable explanations for these remarkable fossils.

In 2011, Fastovsky _et al_. described the first nest from the Djadochta Formation that is actually from _Protoceratops_. This nest contains hatchlings of 15 juvenile _Protoceratops. _These juveniles are no more than 20 cm long and are all approximately facing the same direction. An oval-shaped margin to one portion of the fossil suggests that this is a portion of a round or oval-shaped nest. The baby _Protoceratops_, although tiny, are larger than would be expected from ones that had immediately hatched. This size, along with the lack of egg shells in the nest, suggest they stayed with the nest and were benefited by at least some level of parental care after hatching. The orientation of the juveniles suggests alignment with a sandstorm. This fossil is not consistent with underwater deposition in an underwater sand dune. Answers in Genesis is aware of this fossil, Mitchell, (No Date, possibly 2011) cites this nest as being evidence for Noah&rsquo;s Flood, but seems oblivious to the fossil&rsquo;s actual implications against Flood geology.

## Insect Borings ##

One other taphonomic detail that is inconsistent with an underwater origin of Djadochta Formation dinosaur fossils is the presence of trace fossils consistent with large carrion-feeding insects found in and with the dinosaur skeletons. Kirkland and Bader (2010) and Saneyoshi _et al_. (2011) illustrate and discuss many examples of _Protoceratops_ skeletons, as well as other dinosaur fossils, that have circular holes and damaged areas near their joints. Moreover, there are traces of insect pupation chambers associated with these skeletons. These traces are certainly the result of a large carrion-feeding insect, perhaps similar to modern dermestid beetles, but possibly from another unknown group of beetles. Adult insects would have detected the decaying dinosaurs, burrowed into the unlithified sediment, then fed on the carcasses, eating into the bones and consuming cartilage and any available soft tissue. At some point the insects would have mated and laid eggs within the carcass so their future larvae would have a food source. After feeding and eventually growing to adulthood inside pupae, these larvae would have burrowed to the surface to repeat the process. Duff, 2024 discusses similar, albeit less spectacular, trace fossils associated with Cretaceous dinosaur bones from Mexico described by Serrano-Brana _et al_. (2018) at length as a &ldquo;Flood geology failure.&rdquo;

Saneyoshi _et al_. (2011) also describe a single, larger (31 mm diameter), burrow in a _Protoceratops_ skeleton that could be interpreted as a small mammal feeding trace. None of these insect burrows and damage to the bones make sense in terms of the deposits forming underwater.

## Discussion and Conclusion ##

The new _Protoceratops_ display, and several other dinosaur-related displays already at the Creation Museum (see Phelps, 2007), perpetuate the odd creationist claims that their interpretation and conventional interpretations of geology and paleontology are the result of &ldquo;worldviews.&rdquo; AiG usually presents this as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Human Reason.&rdquo; Of course, &ldquo;human reason&rdquo; loses every time. This claim is part of what is known as &ldquo;presuppositional apologetics&rdquo; in Fundamentalist Christian circles. A typical example is this recent Tweet by Ken Ham (Ham, September 27, 2024) where he states:

> Did you know that creationists and evolutionists have the same facts? Christians and non-Christians have the same facts? The facts are not what people argue/debate over. It&rsquo;s the interpretation of the facts that people argue about. And one&rsquo;s worldview depends on the presuppositions they have. Ultimately, there are only two foundations our worldviews [sic.], God&rsquo;s Word or man&rsquo;s word.

This, and similar arguments for presuppositional apologetics, are often repeated in AiG&rsquo;s vast output of materials, including this new _Protoceratops_ display. However, this is a rather shallow false equivalence by AiG. As this review of what paleontologists and geologists know about the dinosaur _Protoceratops_ and the rocks it was found in demonstrates, AiG only selectively looks at scientific evidence and often ignores a vast amount of contradictory evidence when comparing their Bible-based dogma to scientific evidence. AiG&rsquo;s presuppositionalism requires that everything that contradicts their Biblical explanation is wrong and/or is to be ignored by definition (note AiG&rsquo;s Statement of Faith, cited earlier). The resulting twists of logic from presuppositionsalism can be maddeningly insane. Consider this bizarre statement from 2007 on the AiG website (Answers in Genesis , 2007):

> For a person to make the claim that humans and dinosaurs did not coexist, they would have to be able to see all history at exactly the same time, which would make that person omniscient and omnipresent, qualities of God. So, when someone says emphatically that humans and dinosaurs did not exist together in the past, that person is claiming to be a god, while calling God Himself a liar, or, at best, deceptive.

Moreover, AiG literature usually insist that theirs is **THE** Biblical worldview, when even the majority of their fellow Christians disagree. And this insistence ignores a vast spectrum of other religious and philosophical views. In some of the photographs on social media of the new _Protoceratops_ display, they show another adjacent display that is labeled &ldquo;Most Reliable Dating Method.&rdquo; This display is of a Bible open to the Book of Genesis.

In a YouTube video, Snelling (2022), in an interview with AiG&rsquo;s Simon Turpin, gives his game away by stating their work is really about religious conversion rather than science:

> **Dr. Andrew Snelling**: &ldquo;&hellip;as I said to make sure that this is all freely is available to skeptics and you know arming all our people with the evidence. And of course there&rsquo;ll be further articles in Answers Magazine, on our website, [and] live articles, because <strong>_we want to be able to explain all this in more lay terms so that the average person can be armed with this information to go out and use it as a witnessing tool_</strong> because, after all, Simon, <strong>_you know it&rsquo;s not about winning a scientific argument, you know, it&rsquo;s about removing stumbling blocks that people raise to listening to the Gospel that people need to respond to. And you know we can argue about the scientific evidence until the cows come home, but the bottom line is you can convince people that there is a Flood, but unless you&rsquo;re convinced that they need to respond to Jesus Christ as their Savior, they&rsquo;ll go to Hell._</strong>&rdquo;
>
> **Simon Turpin**: &ldquo;Amen Andrew, we&rsquo;re going to end in a minute.&rdquo;
>
> \[**_Emphasis added by DP_**\]

Snelling comes clean by admitting that creationist &ldquo;science&rdquo; is all about religious conversion. Creationists reach their conclusions by ignoring large swaths of evidence that is contradictory to their dogma and sticking to predetermined conclusions, the evidence be damned. Actual science, in stark contrast, draws its interpretations from looking at multiple lines of evidence.
