<figcaption><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonia_c-album">Polygonia c-album</a></i> &ndash; comma butterfly, September, 2020. The photographer writes, "I was in the garden when this butterfly startled me, as it was so close and came in to land and rest under the log. Very well camouflaged. I didn't see its open wing. It didn't mind me being there. I've never seen one before." Additionally, BugGuide discusses why "c" and why "album" <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/722347">here</a>. Album means white, but the creature looks anything but white to me.
