In my [https://pandasthumb.github.io/posts/2024/dembskiewert1.html](post of 6 June), I commented on the first part of William 
Dembski and Winston Ewert's new book, the second edition of Dembski's 
1998 book <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em>.   I noted that to make the argument 
for a Design Inference they had set aside Dembski's previous criterion 
of Complex Specified Information, and instead replaced it by 
Algorithmic Specified Complexity (ASC).

This is a measure of the difference between the length of a bitstring and the length of a bitstring that produces it. 
It originates from the mathematical work on "randomness deficit", where the bitstring is a binary number, and the smaller bistring is a computer program that computes it.  In that field, numbers that are considered truly random are those generated by programs that are almost as long as the number.  A number that can be generated by a short program is not considered random.


Dembski and Ewert intend to apply this to biology.  The longer number somehow specifies a phenotype, while the shorter number specifies it.  In my previous review, I had reached Chapter 6, "Evolutionary Biology".  Here, let's consider how they argue the ASC criterion can be applied to biological adaptations.  (Spoiler == we're going to be disappointed).
