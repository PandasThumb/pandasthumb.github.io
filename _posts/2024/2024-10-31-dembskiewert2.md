In my <a href="https://pandasthumb.github.io/posts/2024/2024-06-12-dembskiewert1.html">post of 12 June</a>, I commented on the first part of William 
Dembski and Winston Ewert's new book, the second edition of Dembski's 
1998 book <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em>.   I noted that to make the argument 
for a Design Inference they had set aside Dembski's previous criterion 
of Complex Specified Information, and instead replaced it by 
Algorithmic Specified Complexity (ASC).

This is a measure of the difference between the length of a bitstring and the length of a bitstring that describes it. 
It originates from the mathematical work on "randomness deficiciency", where the bitstring is a binary number, and the smaller bistring is a computer program that computes it.  In that field, numbers that are considered truly random are those generated by programs that are almost as long as the number.  A number that can be generated by a short program is not considered random.

Dembski and Ewert intend to apply this to biology.  The longer number somehow specifies a phenotype (or maybe a 
genotype), while the shorter number "describes" it.  In my previous review, I had reached Chapter 6, "Evolutionary Biology".  Here, let's consider how they argue the ASC criterion can be applied to biological adaptations.  (Spoiler -- we're going to be disappointed).

I was full of expectations when I started reading Chapter 7.  I had a number of questions in mind, ones I have 
asked before in posts and comments about their ASC criterion for design inference (for example, here, here, and here).

1. What did the bitstring represent? A genotype?  A phenotype?
2. Was the "description" string a program for computing the larger string?  Was it perhaps some genetic encoding of developmental instructions?
3. When the difference between the lengths of the two is large enough, this is supposed to be astronomically improbable.  Under what distribution?
4. Is the probability somehow able to take into account the possibility of natural selection building up such
large difference step by step?

Chapter 7 has a number of sections.  Let me describe briefly what each covers, and what it accomplishes:

### Insulating Evolution against Small Probabilities (pages 321-326) ##

Dembski and Ewert describe the success and wide acceptance of their design inference in evolutionary biology.  They then say "And now back to the real world".  The success and acceptance, they accept, has not happened in reality.  This is because evolutionary biologists have been resistant to accepting that evolution of biological systems involves 
probabilities that small.  They have done so by invoking mechanisms of cumulative selection.  As an example Dembski and Ewert describe Richard Dawkins's teaching example of a simple form of simulated natural selection starting with a random 28-letter sequence of letters and spaces, and reaching the target phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL" in hundreds or thousands of steps, instead of the 10<sup>40</sup> steps it would take if one simply drew new 28-letter sequences at random.

### Variations on the WEASEL (pages 326-330) ###

Evolutionary biologists are obsessed by the Weasel example (I would say it is creationists and advocates of Design that 
are actually the ones obsessed with it). "Perhaps design theorists should shift focus to the origin of life".  (The infamous OTOOL tactic -- Off To the Origin Of Life).  There cumulative selection cannot play a role, they argue.  Simulations like the Weasel are declared to be "suggestive but misleading, so removed from biological reality that they cannot decide the matter".

### Resetting Darwinian Evolution's Bayesian Prior (pages 331-336) ###

Considering the choice between design and natural selection as a Bayesian Inference, it is important what prior probabilities one assigns these two hypotheses.  If one gives design a low enough prior probability, it cannot have any reasonably high posterior probability.  A design inference can be used to "sweep the field clear of all relevant chance hypotheses". (Actually they could only do that if they could show that the probability of the data, given natural selection, was zero, but Demsbki and Ewert don't quite mean that, they mean showing that the data is astronomically improbable).  Biologists argue that there may be many other "chance hypotheses", but this is an argument but mere possibility as they do not produce these.

### Who Is Arguing from Ignorance? (pages 337-339) ###

The biologists are, since they essentially never produce the exact sequence of events needed to evolve these biological systems.  However, they accuse the design theorists of arguing from ignorance.


### John Stuart Mill's Method of Difference (pages 340-345) ###

Mill argued that if two situations differ in only one circumstance and a phenomenon occurs in one and not in the other, this circumstance is the effect, or cause.   Biologists such as Kenneth Miller say that all that is needed for natural selection to work is the presence of selection, replication, and mutation.  But these do not automatically lead to "complexity" or something "interesting".  The evolution experiments of Sol Spiegelman and of Richard Lenski do not show those, but have genomes that rapidly decay.

### The Challenge of Multiple Simultaneous Mutations (pages 345-352) ###
