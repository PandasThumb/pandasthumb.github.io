Astronaut Barry “Butch” Wilmore is an ardent supporter of Answers in Genesis. Captain Wilmore is stuck, possibly until next year, on the International Space Station (ISS) because of concerns with the safety of the Boeing Starliner capsule. Apparently, Ken Ham will get tons of publicity from support by astronaut Wilmore, who can be seen wearing an Ark Encounter T-shirt and hat in the photo. Captain Wilmore has also taken separate photos of two different Ark baseball caps on the ISS. 

Mr. Ham is already hawking “as seen in space” merchandise promoting the Ark <a href=”https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/08/30/as-seen-in-space/”>here</a>. He writes:

<blockquote><strong>These “as seen in space” items are available on our online store or at the attractions.</strong> It’s a fun way to promote the Ark and talk about a man who is bold in his witness for Jesus Christ and the truth of God’s Word from the very first verse, even while working as an astronaut with NASA.</blockquote>

The cost to send a payload to the ISS is about $10,000/lb, <a href=”https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-and-marketing-pricing-policy/”>according to NASA</a>. Moreover, it was probably much more expensive to send anything on the ill-fated Boeing Starliner. If the T-shirt weighs about 5 or 6 ounces and the two caps combined weigh a similar amount, then the cost of getting them into orbit was around $8,000. Although NASA allows astronauts to have personal items, both NASA and the International Space Station have explicit guidelines for advertising.  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-brand-center/advertising-guidelines/">NASA’s guidelines</a> appear to explicitly forbid Wilmore’s advertising for Answers in Genesis: 

<blockquote><p><strong> Advertising and Marketing on the International Space Station </strong> </p>
<p> Commercials and other marketing filming/activity on the International Space Station authorized by the <a href="https://www3.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/s1701746119060610280_1.pdf"> NASA Interim Directive (NID) on Use of International Space Station (ISS) for Commercial and Marketing Activities</a> are additionally subject to the following guidelines: </p>
<p> NASA support in filming/capturing commercials or other marketing videos, which will occur behind the scenes, shall not be used to indicate or imply that NASA approves or endorses the requesting entity or its products, services, or enterprises. No commercials or promotional materials filmed on ISS may imply such approval or endorsement, nor may NASA stock images or footage be used in a way that does so. … </p> </blockquote>

<strike>The commercials or other marketing filming should not reference NASA support needed to create the materials, including any mention that NASA astronauts were involved in the filming.
The commercials or marketing materials filmed are not permitted to show activities that are distinguishable as NASA activities.
The commercials or other marketing materials shall not use any corporate name(s), logo(s), or trademark(s) depicted in marketing activities without permission.
The NASA Insignia may not appear with other corporate products, identifying marks, or properties.
Requests to film marketing materials on the ISS will also be approved in writing by the Multimedia Division of NASA’s Office of Communications. The Multimedia Division will receive such requests from the Johnson Space Center (JSC) after the commercial partner has developed its proposal in consultation with JSC.</strike>

The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/1214.403">rules for the ISS crew</a> state:

<blockquote> ISS crewmembers shall refrain from any use of the position of ISS crewmember that is motivated, or has the appearance of being motivated, by private gain, including financial gain, for himself or herself or other persons or entities. …</blockquote>
  
  <strike> Performance of ISS duties shall not be considered to be motivated by private gain. Furthermore, no ISS crewmember shall use the position of ISS crewmember in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to himself or herself or other persons or entities. 
D. Mementos and Personal Effects 
Each ISS crewmember may carry and store mementos, including flags, patches, insignia, and similar small items of minor value, onboard the ISS, for his or her private use, subject to the following: 
(1) mementos are permitted as a courtesy, not an entitlement; as such they shall be considered as ballast as opposed to a  payload or mission requirement and are subject to manifest limitations, on-orbit stowage allocations, and safety considerations; 
(2) mementos may not be sold, transferred for sale, used or transferred for personal gain, or used or transferred for any commercial or fundraising purpose.  Mementos which, by their nature, lend themselves to exploitation by the recipients, or which, in the opinion of the Cooperating Agency providing the ISS crewmember, engender questions as to good taste, will not be permitted. 
An ISS crewmember's personal effects, such as a wristwatch, will not be considered mementos. Personal effects of any nature may be permitted, subject to constraints of mass/volume allowances for crew personal effects, approval of the ISS crewmember's Cooperating Agency, and approval of the transporting Cooperating Agency and considerations of safety and good taste. 
If a Cooperating Agency carries and stores items onboard the ISS in connection with separate arrangements, these items will not be considered mementos of the ISS crewmembers.”</strike>

Captain Wilmore certainly gives the appearance of promoting the for-profit Ark Encounter and the non-profit Answers in Genesis ministry at US taxpayer expense. Ken Ham will probably make a lot of money off the shirt and cap sales. I predict that NASA and the ISS will ignore this apparent violation of their own rules to avoid negative publicity and pushback from AIG’s supporters. Mr. Ham and AIG once again triumph in getting a benefit from the taxpayer. <strong> Dan – Has anyone told NASA? </strong>
