<big>[_Buteo jamaicensis_](http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/41/overview/Red-tailed_Hawk.aspx) -- red-tailed hawk, Boulder Valley Ranch, Colorado.  Eddie Boosey of Norfolk, England, tells me \[apparently incorrectly\], "It is Swainson's buzzard, [_Buteo swainsoni_](http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/44/overview/Swainsons_Hawk.aspx). You can tell that it is a buzzard because it is called _Buteo_. In America, however, for some unknown reasons this, like your seven other buzzards, is called a hawk, so it is known as Swainson's hawk." Eddie and I are often [separated by a common language](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/English_language).</big>
