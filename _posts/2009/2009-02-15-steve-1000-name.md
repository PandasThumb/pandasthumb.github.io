This weekend, NCSE named [Steve #1000](http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/02/steve-darwin-is-steve-1000-004308).  After much secrecy, they revealed that [Dr. Steven P. Darwin](http://www.tulane.edu/~darwin/homepage.htm) of Tulane University in New Orleans was the 1000th member of [Project Steve](http://ncseweb.org/taking-action/project-steve-faq).

> Dr. Steve Darwin -- no relation to Charles -- has been a botanist and evolutionary biologist for over thirty years. Darwin is not only a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Tulane University in New Orleans, but also Director of Tulane's herbarium, which boasts 115,000 specimens, with a focus on flora from the southeastern United States. He is the author of thirty-five publications in the field of plant biology.
