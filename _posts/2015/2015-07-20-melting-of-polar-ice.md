<big>[Melting of polar ice](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/). Mr. Moore writes, "Our ship got caught in the ice and had to be freed by a Canadian ice breaker. Global warming &ndash; what?? Actually, yes &ndash; we could not get through because so much ice broke free further north near the polar ice cap and was blown south into the shipping channels." Mr. Moore will receive a signed copy of [Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-Works-Creationism-Fails/dp/0813545501), which has been donated by one of the authors.</big>
