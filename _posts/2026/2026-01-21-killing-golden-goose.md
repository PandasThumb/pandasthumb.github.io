This is just a short note, with no comment, to alert our readers to a splendid article, <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/killing-the-golden-goose-evangelicals-trump-and-the-war-on-science/">Killing the Golden Goose: Evangelicals, Trump, and the War on Science</a>, by Rodney Kennedy. Dr. Kennedy is a writer and was formerly pastor at the First Baptist Church of Dayton, an American Baptist Church, and several other churches. His article is hosted by <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/">Righting America</a>, which is a forum for scholarly conversation run by William Trollinger and Susan Trollinger.

In brief, Kennedy argues that science is the goose that laid the golden eggs and made America prosperous. Evangelicals, he says, have targeted science for over a century. But now something has changed, and conservative evangelicals allied with Donald Trump have taken direct aim at the entire scientific enterprise.

Kennedy outlines "only a few of [Robert F.] Kennedy's devastating moves," "Trump's disastrous handling of the pandemic," and how "[s]cience before MAGA [made America] the greatest scientific nation in the world." As a result, he says, scientists are desperate to find jobs in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere.
