According to the National Center for Science Education, International Darwin Day, which is technically Darwin's birthday on February 12, actually begins today in Denver. You may find a worldwide schedule <a href="https://darwinday.org/events/">here</a>. A plurality of celebrations occurs on February 12, but you may find other events into April.

Additionally, NCSE reminds us, <a href="https://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rasweekend2026.html">Religion and Science Weekend</a> is February 13-15 and approximately coincides with Darwin Day.
