<figcaption><i><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pileated_Woodpecker/overview#">Dryocopus pileatus</a></i> &ndash; (male) pileated woodpecker, Ten Mile River Greenway, Rumford, R.I. Mr. Eissenberg writes, "Pileated woodpeckers not only feed on grubs and other insects in rotting wood, they also carve meticulously sculpted nesting holes in the sides of dead trees. These birds make a strong visual case for the dinosaurian origin of birds!"
