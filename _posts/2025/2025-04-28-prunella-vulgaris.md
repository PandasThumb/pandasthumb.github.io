<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunella_(plant)"><i>Prunella vulgaris</i></a> &ndash; self-heal, heal-all. Ms. Susek writes, "I decided not to mow the lawn in May this year [2021] as suggested by the professional gardeners to see what grew as well as the grass. I knew I would get some daisies and plantain and some self-heal. I always look forward to self-heal as a lot is said about its healing properties.  It is known as an herb that is said to be good for health when dried and used to make tea." The University of Arkansas Extension service <a href="https://www.uaex.uada.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/prunella-vulgaris-heal-all-02-12-2016.aspx">discusses the medicinal properties</a> of <i>P. vulgaris</i>.
