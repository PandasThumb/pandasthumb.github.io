The eminent physicist R.W. Wood is well remembered for his work <a href="https://archive.org/details/physicaloptic00wood/">Physical Optics</a>, published in 1911. I always had a paperback handy and used it well into the 1990's. In 1907, Wood published <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1593">How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers</a>, A Manual of Flornithology for Beginners</i>, illustrated by the author. His discussion of the puffin follows:
<blockquote><p>Upon this cake of ice is perched,</p>
<p>The paddle-footed Puffin</p>
<p>To find his double we have searched,</p>
<p>But have discoveredâ€”Nuffin!</p></blockquote>
The puffin is the only creature in the book that has no double.
