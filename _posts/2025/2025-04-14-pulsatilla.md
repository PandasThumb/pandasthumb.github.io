<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatilla"><i>Pulsatilla</i> sp.</a> &ndash; pasqueflower, possibly<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatilla_vulgaris"> <i>P. vulgaris</i></a>, European pasqueflower, but please correct me. It is cultivated, growing in a xeric garden at Chautauqua in Boulder, Colorado, April, 2025. iNaturalist says, "Introduced in East Colorado, US, CO: arrived in the region via anthropogenic means." FWIW, pasque is old French for Easter, yesterday was Easter, and the day before was Passover, otherwise known as Pesach, which is the root from which pasque derives.
