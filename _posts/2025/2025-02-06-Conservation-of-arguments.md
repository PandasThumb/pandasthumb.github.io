William Dembski has recently made two posts ([on January 10](https://evolutionnews.org/2025/01/the-displacement-fallacy-evolutions-shell-game/) and [on January 20](https://evolutionnews.org/2025/01/conservation-of-information-the-history-of-an-idea/)) at
_Evolution News_, the advocacy site of the Discovery Institute's Center for 
Science and Culture.  He describes them as sections of a paper he 
submitted to the DI's house journal BIO-Complexity.  The paper was not 
immediately accepted, he said, and in the meantime he wanted to post the
sections at EN.

As Dembski declares in the preface to the first of these posts, their argument in these posts is, in effect, that

> Conservation of information is a big result of the intelligent design literature, even if to date it hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves. It quantifies the amount of information needed to increase the probability of finding a needle in a haystack so that the needle can actually be found. The upshot of conservation of information is that the information needed to find a needle in a haystack in turn requires finding another needle in a haystack, implying there is no free lunch in search.

In Dembski's account, when evolutionary biologists argue that processes such as natural selection can put 
adaptive information into the genome, they are failing to explain where the information comes from.  They are 
building it into their evolutionary algorithms as a detailed goal, and not informing the reader that they have done that.  The biologists' argument has thus simply displaced the question, not answered it.  Dembski's first post is illustrated by an illustration of the Shell Game, to label the argument of evolutionary biologists as a dishonest trick.

Actually, the two posts leave Dembski's argument no further than it was 
some years ago.  We can deal with it without going into great detail, 
because we have seen these arguments before.  Let's ask, and answer, some brief questions as to what 
was accomplished:

<!--more-->

## Does his argument clarify how his Algorithmically Specified Complexity deals with natural selection? ##

No, not at all.  That argument, which was the centerpiece of Dembski and Ewert's recent book: _The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities, 2nd edition_, which I discussed [here](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/11/dembskiewert2.html) recently, was left hanging, with 
the essential questions unanswered.  And Dembski' recent two EN posts do not discuss ASC at all.

## Have we seen the arguments of these EN posts before? ##

Yes.  Applied to evolution, the conservation of information argument is 
the Active Information argument of Dembski and Marks, which has been 
discussed [here](https://www.evoinfo.org/papers/2009_ConservationOfInformationInSearch.pdf) and [here](https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/download/BIO-C.2013.4/BIO-C.2013.4).  It basicaly says that 
if natural selection can find genotypes of better fitness by climbing 
uphill on a fitness surface, that this _is_ an increase of 
information in the genome.  But, they argued, it is not creating new information, 
beause the information was already there in the structure of 
the fitness surface.

## Does the Active Information argument rule out any role for natural selection? ##

Not at all, as you can see. 

## So Dembski (and Ewert and Marks) accept that natural selection explains adaptations? ##

No, they are arguing that _if_ natural selection can increase 
specfied information in the genome, this is not new 
information.  But they have always been very resistant to 
acknowledging that natural selection does much in 
evolution. In the first of the two EN posts that we 
are discussing, Dembski grapples with Richard Dawkins's 
book _Climbing Mount Improbable_.  Dawkins gives examples of 
natural selection achieving major adaptations by gradual 
small changes.  Dembski calls Dawkins's argument "displacement", 
arguing this way:

> It could be that Mount Improbable is sheer on all sides and getting to the top via baby-steps is effectively impossible. Consequently, it is not enough to presuppose that a fitness-increasing sequence of baby steps always connects biological systems.

## Connection to Dembski's 2002 _No Free Lunch_ argument ##

Dembski argues that fitness surfaces that allow natural selection to work are unlikely, and their existence needs explanation:

> Mountains, after all, do not magically materialize — they have to be formed by some process of mountain formation. Of all the different ways Mount Improbable might have emerged, how many are sheer so that no gradual path to the summit exists? And how many do allow a gradual path to the summit? A Mount Improbable with gradual paths to the top may itself be improbable.

Improbable in what sense?  We'll see that only a tiny fraction of all possible fitness surfaces 
will be smooth -- but this is true only if all possible fitness surfaces are equally probable.  Which they definitely are not.  Smooth ones are vastly more peobable.

## Connection to the No Free Lunch argument ##

The issue has come up before, in Dembski's 2001 book "No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence".  There he invokes a mathematical theorem about the success of search algorithms on all possible problems.  This is the No Free Lunch theorem of Wolpert and Macready, which shows that _averaged over all possible problems_ all search algorithms do equally well, and are no more successful than examining a random set of points and choosing the best.   Wolpert and Macready did not prove that all search algorithms will do that badly in finding large values of, say, fitness on all fitness surfaces.  As Dembski's title says, he cites Wolpert and Macready's theorem as showing that we need to invoke intelligence to explain how evolution on fitness surfaces could find genomes of better fitness.

## Dembski's 2001 No Free Lunch argument was refuted ##
