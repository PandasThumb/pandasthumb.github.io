<figcaption><i><a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/wildlife-explorer/birds/crows-and-shrikes/jay">Garrulus glandarius</a></i> &ndash; Eurasian jay, 16 June 2025, in a narrow lane in Chelsea, London SW3, iPhone 15. Mr. Abrams notes, "This juvenile, judging by size,  Eurasian jay was sheltering in a doorway from attacks by a couple of adult magpies (<i>Pica pica</i>).  Once theyâ€™d been driven off it let me approach quite close &ndash; within a couple of metres.  Unsurprisingly, it was panting, so I assume it felt stressed."
