<figcaption>Spider about to lunch on a box elder bug, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boisea_trivittata">Boisea trivittata</a></i>. If the bug is approximately 1&nbsp;cm long, the spider must be a few millimeters. The spider repeatedly dashed in, perhaps to sting the bug, and then dashed out nervously, before settling in to dine. If anyone can identify the spider I will edit the post (the image is too small for BugGuide).

<figcaption>Incidentally, a snapshot of a box elder bug that I posted in 2008, before the Big Computer Crash. It shows the markings on the bug better than the picture with the spider.</figcaption>
