<figcaption><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba"> Ginkgo biloba</a></i> &ndash; ginkgo leaf after a heavy rain. Mr. Denelsbeck notes, "The leaves are quite water-repellent (hydrophobic) and cause the water to form almost-spherical drops under their own surface tension, which allows them to become lenses by themselves &ndash; you can see them showing further drops behind themselves. Often called a "living fossil," ginkgos are the last of their 300 my order, Ginkgoales, and easily distinguished by the leaf 'veins' which do not branch, but all originate from the base of the stem in a fanlike manner. This trait, along with the water-repellence, helps funnel water down to the trunk and thus to roots that would otherwise be blocked or redirected by the leaves.
