It's a close run thing. I would narrowly give second place to Answers in Genesis, which blames Bryan’s humiliation on <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2025/06/13/partnering-with-faithful-fathers/">his willingness to contemplate an ancient Earth</a>. But first place, to Mike Mueller, writing for <strike>Creation Research International (CRI)</strike> <a href="https://www.icr.org/article/scopes-monkey-trial-battle-worldviews/">Institute for Creation Research (ICR)</a> , which takes on the interesting task of seeing how well the scientific evidence has held up, gets every single detail wrong, and tells more than the usual number of lies in the process. 

Early on: “Eventually the Butler Act was overturned.”

“Eventually” means in 1967! Forty-two years after the trial, seventeen years after the establishment of the National Science Foundation, and six years after the publication of <i>The Genesis Flood</i> led to the resurgence of young Earth creationism. And it was not “overturned,” but repealed. This matters because of ongoing creationist complaints about judicial activism; it was a decision by the State Governor, rather than the outcome of a lawsuit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act">although</a> it was indeed a pending freedom of speech lawsuit that forced the issue.

<blockquote>[S]upposed experts presented some of the following topics as proof. Many are still used, but the scientific evidence actually supports creation, not evolution. Consider the claims and our brief responses.</blockquote>

The “supposed” experts included half a dozen professors of geology, zoology, agriculture, and education from the Universities of Chicago, New Jersey, and Missouri, Johns Hopkins, and Harvard, as well as the State Geologist of Tennessee (the location of the trial), and, for good measure, a rabbi. Their combined testimony, available <a href="https://profjoecain.net/scopes-monkey-trial-1925-complete-trial-transcripts/">here</a>, runs to 35 closely argued pages. It is an admirable document, including among other things the use of molecular biology (in the form of serology) to show that whales are related to hoofed animals. And of course none of it was “presented” at the trial, but merely deposited without being presented to jury, since the judge (in a sense, correctly) regarded it as irrelevant to whether Scopes had broken the law. But consider now the individual claims as summarized and allegedly refuted by <strike>CRI</strike> ICR:

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: Evolution from simple cells to complex life, bacteria to man, is a fact.

<strong>Response</strong>: The trial experts admitted they didn’t know where the first cell came from and weren’t clear on the process or method evolution uses. </blockquote>

Indeed, we don’t know the origins of life. So what? We don’t know the origins of language, either, but we do know an enormous amount about how languages have evolved. As for not being clear on process or method, we are as would be expected a lot clearer now than we were a hundred years ago. Again, so what? 

At this point, Mueller makes reference to a new theory being developed by Randy Giulizza, which he describes as based on engineering approach. This asserts that organisms have an inbuilt ability to modify their development in the face of new environmental challenges. Lamarckism, combined with the gift of prophecy.

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: Ape-to-human evolution is demonstrated by fossils.

<strong>Response</strong>: The so-called missing links between ape and man are still missing. No discoveries show that humans descended from primates, and the fossil specimens presented in the trial and since have turned out to be fully human, fully ape or animal, a mixture of human and animal, or fraudulent.</blockquote>

The specimens described at the trial were Java Man (now classified as <i>Homo erectus</i>, which branched off from our own line of descent some 2 million years ago); Heidelberg Man (now regarded as ancestral to both Neanderthal Man and anatomically modern humans); Piltdown Man, concerning which Professor Horatio Hackett Newman stated in his deposition that “there has been a great deal of controversy as to their significance. Until the experts arrive at an agreement about this type it might be well for others to reserve judgment”; Neanderthal Man (whose status as a close but distinct sister species to us is of course now well established); Rhodesia Man (regarded as related to Heidelberg Man); and a then recently discovered child’s skull which we now classify as <i>Australopithecus africanus</i>. So there were already an impressive collection of “missing links,” which could not really be classified either as fully human or as fully ape, and the only fraud in the bunch came with a warning label. What we have learned since has greatly added to the number of ancestral species and sister lines of descent. As for any attempted division into “fully human” or “fully ape,” that is simply a pathology of rigid binary thinking.

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: The geological record proves evolution because simple life forms are buried in the deepest geological layers.

<strong>Response</strong>: The fossil record documents the ecological zones that were progressively flooded and buried in the global Flood of Genesis. </blockquote>

All geological layers display a full range of ecological zones, to the point that we can compare extinct species with modern species showing similar lifestyles. 

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: The earth is millions of years old, allowing for evolution to have occurred.

<strong>Response</strong>: Many dating methods used to assign millions-of-years ages to rock specimens are based on unprovable assumptions and/or produce inconsistent results. Most evidence clearly supports a young earth and coincides with the biblical timeframe of around 6,000 years.</blockquote>

The creationist list of “unprovable assumptions,” namely amount of daughter material initially present, the possible mobility of isotopes, and the constancy of radioactive decay constants, is cut-and-paste from classical papers on the subject, dating back to around 1910. My favorite account of how these problems have been overcome is <a href="https://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens2002.pdf">Radiometric dating; a Christian perspective</a>, by Roger Wiens at Los Alamos, himself an evangelical Christian. Simply put, the first two problems are overcome by looking at more than two isotopes, and where possible at rock grains within which the initial incorporation of daughter would have been impossible, while the radioactive decay constants depend on fundamental laws that must have been the same when the rocks were laid down, or we would never have had such rocks. As for “Most evidence,” this refers to methods based on such things as the thickness of sediments or the salinity of the oceans, which consider the rate of deposition of substances but not their removal. These were in any case regarded, until superseded by radiometric dating, as indicating an age of the earth of around 100 million years. I’m not aware of any method that supports 6,000 years, except for recent geological phenomena such as Niagara Falls.

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: The tailbone, appendix, wisdom teeth, and other organs are vestigial features.

<strong>Response</strong>: Parts of organisms once thought to be useless evolutionary leftovers are today known to have important functions. They were designed according to God’s plan.</blockquote>

If evolution is correct, we would expect organs that had lost their initial function to undergo one of two fates: total disappearance (in which case we would not see them now even as vestiges) or, an interesting possibility clearly realized by Darwin, modification with change of function. Thus the human appendix is now thought to act as a useful refugium for essential gut bacteria, while the whale’s residual hind limbs serve to anchor muscles used, I have read, to hold the parties together during sex.

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: Genetic similarity and breeding results support evolution.

<strong>Response</strong>: Human and ape DNA are now known to be 84% similar, not 98% as initially claimed. And variation between plant and animal species can be managed by controlled genetic breeding. This is not evidence of gradual change driven by random mutations over millions of years.</blockquote>

It has been known for a very long time that roughly 15% of human and chimpanzee DNA is not directly comparable, because of major deletions and inversions, while the 98% similarity refers to that part of the genome where direct comparison is possible. Every so often, some new analysis reminds creationists of these familiar facts, and they gleefully point out that 84% is less than 98%, thus to their satisfaction refuting the argument from genetic similarity.

<blockquote><strong>Claim</strong>: Embryonic development and comparative embryology between animals prove that living organisms came from a common ancestor because their developing embryos echo evolutionary stages.

<strong>Response</strong>: This idea was popularized in 1866 by Ernst Haeckel. He was later reprimanded for using fraudulent drawings. Unfortunately, students are still told that developing babies go through evolutionary history with gill slits, a tail, and yolk sacs, even though this is false. </blockquote>

Of all dishonest creationist arguments, this is the one that I find most annoying. There is no way in which our present knowledge of embryology is affected by possible dishonesty in Haeckel’s work over 150 years ago. Human embryos do indeed “go through evolutionary history with gill slits, a tail, and yolk sacs,” as is evident in the freely viewable images of weeks 6 and 7 on <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy/week-by-week">the Babycenter site</a>. As spelled out in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.280.5366.983c">a key paper</a> by the very author that creationists most frequently quote:

<blockquote>On a fundamental level, Haeckel was correct: All vertebrates develop a similar body plan (consisting of notochord, body segments, pharyngeal pouches, and so forth). This shared developmental program reflects shared evolutionary history. It also fits with overwhelming recent evidence that development in different animals is controlled by common genetic mechanisms.</blockquote>

On a fundamental level, I have questions of my own. Are the <strike>CRI</strike> ICR scientists, some with reputable training, knowingly telling lies? Or do they think that they are legitimately simplifying complex matters to make them clearer to a lay audience? Or are their cognitive filters and biases so well developed that they can see only what confirms their case, even when looking directly at information that refutes it?

Difficult questions, but relevant to the choice of counter-tactics, and on which I would much appreciate readers’ opinions.
