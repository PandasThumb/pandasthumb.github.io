<figcaption><i><a href="https://www.smgrowers.com/products/plants/plantdisplay.asp?plant_id=543">Echium candicans</a></i> &ndash; pride of Madeira. Mr. Trawick notes, "Pride of Madeira is rare in its native Madeira but has become very common in California, especially the San Diego area. Though very pretty, the sap is toxic. These attract a lot of honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) when blooming.
