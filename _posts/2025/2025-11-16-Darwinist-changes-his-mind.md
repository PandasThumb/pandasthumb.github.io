The Discovery Institute's website "Science and Culture" (formerly Evolution 
News and Views) had a dramatic story of conversion recently.  A post 
entitled "He Taught Darwinism for Decades (Then Changed His Mind)" by
Andrew McDiarmid on 30 October 2025.  It announced that 


> For decades, British professor and author Neil Thomas was a card-carrying Darwinist. It wasn’t until after he retired from academia that he had the repose to think about things objectively. 
Then one day, in a scientific flash of inspiration, he came to the conclusion that the standard Darwinian story was “rubbish.”

The result is that Neil Thomas has written two books, published by 
the DI's publishing outfit, Discovery Institute Press:  [Taking Leave of Darwin: A longtime Agnostic Discovers the Case for Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1637120036)
and [False Messiah: Darwinism as The God That Failed](https://www.amazon.com/False-Messiah-Darwinism-That-Failed/dp/163712080X).  He has also 
made numbers of posts at Science and Culture since 2021, see them [here](https://scienceandculture.com/author/nthomas/).  He was intervewed in a 
two-part ([part 11](https://idthefuture.com/2127/) and [part 2](https://idthefuture.com/2128/)) series by Jonathan Witt in 2021 and by Andrew McDiarmid in 2025.
in the DI's series "ID The Future".

Thomas cannot understand how biologists ever believed Darwin's mechanism of natural 
selection.  So: has someone who has been devoted to teaching biology students about 
Darwin and natural selection recently changed his mind?  If so, should we pay close 
attention to his arguments?

Well ...

I hasten to say that I have not read these two books, though I have listened to the 
two podcast interviews.  In the podcasts, Thomas expresses his sceptyicism about 
the origin of Life, and about whether natural selection can account for the 
complexity of humans/  But he does not explain why natural selection cannot account 
for adaptations of biological organisms once life has arisen.



Let's look at a couple of the arguments Thomas uses against "Darwinism".  First, McDiarmid 
summarizes Thomas's rejection of "Darwinism" as a conclusion
