The Discovery Institute's "Evolution News" is always a great place to look for tenuous and dubious arguments against evolutionary 
biology.  Lately they have been touting a book by EN journalist David Klinghoffer, published by Discovery Press, 
the DI's house publisher.  The book is "[Plato’s Revenge: The New Science of the Immaterial Genome](https://discovery.press/b/platos-revenge/)".   Emily Sandico, a DI staff writer, has [a piece calling attention to the book]( https://evolutionnews.org/2025/04/platos-revenge-intelligent-design-in-real-time/).

The book by Klinghoffer describes the views of Richard Sternberg.  Sternberg has two 
Ph.D. degrees, one in molecular evolution and another in systems science.  His
own web page ([here](https://richardsternberg.com/)) explains that, in his view

> Evolutionary genetics leaves open the central issue of how the one dimensional genotype can specify the four dimensional phenotype. The approach I am taking to this problem is a variant of structural realism, by which I mean that biological phenomena are manifestations of logico-mathematical structures. This perspective is orthogonal to the origins debate, if you will, because all historical actualities are understood to be space-time instances of pre-existing non-temporal possibilities. Within this context one can accept all that is empirically valid in evolutionary biology, while not axiomatically dismissing the position that structures as well as their “real” instantiations have an intelligent cause. My position asserts that the cosmos is fundamentally intelligible in such a way that it can be logically, mathematically, and scientifically recognized to be such; and moreover–following Proclus–that the universe emanates from Nous (mind). In this sense my thinking is compatible with intelligent design broadly defined.

Sternberg's site also links to [a PDF](https://www.discovery.org/f/54005/) explaining in more detail how he came to his views.

To Klinghoffer, as quoted by Sandico's post

> When Dr. Sternberg thinks of ID, he’s thinking of the here and now. With echoes in the ancient philosophy of Plato, which pointed to immaterial “forms” shaping life, he finds scientific evidence of agency at work in the formation of every embryo, the development of every organism in the womb, and in the ongoing operation of every cell. The genome is not a material entity alone — DNA — but one that transcends space and time, employing DNA as an instrument, right now. 

which he calls "intelligent design in real time".  Andrew McDiarmid, EN's head of podcasts, has interviewed Klinghoffer ([here](https://evolutionnews.org/2025/05/platos-revenge-the-next-scientific-revolution/)) about his book on Sternberg's views.

To me this all sounds a bit strange.  Plato argued that real organisms were but imperfect reflections of ideal forms, which existed in some other realm. 
What evidence do Sternberg, Klinghoffer, Sandico, and McDiarmid have that this is so?  Let's look at an example ...

The example is explained by Daniel Witt, in an EN post ([here](https://evolutionnews.org/2025/02/biologist-michael-levin-a-farewell-to-physicalism/)), where he explains and interprets the views of Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University who works on developmental algorithms.  According to Witt's explanation,

> There is important information in the DNA, of course. But organisms seem to develop with a goal in mind, so to speak, and are able reach that goal in spite of shifting and inherently unpredictable circumstances. This is significant, because if the circumstances and the developmental pathways necessary to adapt to them are unpredictable, then those pathways cannot have been programmed into the organism in advance. They have to be invented on-the-fly.

Another, more recent EN post about Levin's views is by medical researcher Steven Iacoboni ([here](https://evolutionnews.org/2025/04/life-itself-in-michael-levins-platonism-teleology-advances/)).
Levin gives his own summary of his views in a preprint available [from the Open Science Foundation site](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5g2xj_v2).  

Levin does invoke Platonism, and proposes that "mind" rather than physical entities are fundamental in nature.  Andreas Wagner, in his book "The Arrival of the Fittest" also invokes Platonism and proposes that there may be "a library of forms" in nature.

## Telos? ##

The Evolution News posters view Levin's and Wagner's views as evidence for "telos" (purposeness) in nature, and argue that this is evidence for supernatural processes.  Levin and Wagner do not go that far.
A central argument seems to be that if an organism can compensate for developmental accidents, and end up changing so as to achieve a desirable form, then thisis only possible if there is telos, teleological change.
In particular, if organisms can
