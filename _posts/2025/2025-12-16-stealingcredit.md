    Lately, the Discovery Institute's ID site Science and Culture has had almost 
    no arguments that would convince any scientist that Intelligent Design 
    contributed to the diversity of life.  Michael Behe's arguments are the 
    same as before, and William Dembski's latest versions of his specified 
    complexity argument leaves out any discussion of why having a large 
    value (of his Algorithmic Specified Complexity) cannot be achieved by 
    ordinary evolutionary processes.

    But at S&amp;C they *are* getting a bit angry at evolutionary biologists. For 
    stealing credit that belongs to ID advocates.  A post on December 12, 
    is titled "All the Evidence Points to Design, but the Credit Goes to ... You Know What". 
    Even more remarkably, its author is "Science and Culture".  This makes it 
    an official statement by the site.  Or else none of their people want to 
    take credit or blame for it.

    They simply point to an article at BioEssays on "spatiotemporal cues in 
    cell division", in particular to its last paragraph, which contains the 
    sentence (boldface text is S&amp;C's emphasis):
    
    >  **Why evolution selected chromosomes** as a platform to integrate different signals 
    > is easily explained by the need to concentrate mitotic regulators (and their control) 
    > which would otherwise dilute in a vast cytoplasmic ocean.


and S&amp;C's comment is 

> Many years ago, William Dembski said that one of the most objectionable aspects of modern evolutionary theory was the undeserved, unearned credit it steals from the exquisite, transcendentally elegant work of the Designer. Put more bluntly, evolution is a credit thief, a lowdown sleazy embezzler. If we could personify evolution, we’d have ChatGPT make a drawing of the word as a convict with a prison serial number across its chest.
> But if you just put your thumb over the word “evolution” in the phrase we highlighted, all the evidence for design is still there, and it’s just too cool for words.

See, all the wonderful details of biological systems must be evidence for Intelligent Design, 
it's so obvious that they figure anyone can see this.  If a biologist lapses into 
teleological language that personifies evolution, this must mean they acknowledge 
that Design Intervention happened, but are too scared to admit it, and give credit to 
a personified Evolution instead.

Well, the matter can be looked at another way ...

Evolutionary biologists would mostly not bother to pay attention, 
but those that did would notice that S&amp;C is impressed by 
lots of phenotypes and behaviors that are the result of natural 
selection.  They would notice that the BioEssays article yields 
to an unfortunate temptation to personify natural selection, in 
a burst of enthusiasm at the end of the article.

As to who is stealing credit, it is clear that S&amp;C is.  But this 
is mostly silly, rather than distressing.
