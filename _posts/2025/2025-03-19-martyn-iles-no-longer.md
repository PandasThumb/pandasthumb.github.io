Dan Phelps informs us that Martyn Iles is no longer with Answers in Genesis (AIG). Paul Braterman <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/11/Martyn-Iles-Is-Executive.html">reported earlier</a> on PT that Mr. Iles had ascended to the position of "Executive CEO" of AIG. I think we had all assumed that he was the heir apparent. Mr. Phelps asks,

<blockquote>He was apparently [Ken] Ham's chosen successor. I noticed he didn't do much lately. Was there a dispute, or other trouble? Who will Ham pick to succeed him? Will there be a puff of white smoke above the Ark when the decision is made?</blockquote>

We do not know the answers to any of those questions, but it is easy to infer from the Facebook post (reproduced below the fold) that Mr. Iles left AIG before he had an alternative in mind. Mr. Phelps notes further that Mr. Iles's name had been dropped from the AIG speakers' biography page by March 13, but it was there on February 3.

If anyone has any further information, please feel free to comment, but please avoid idle speculation and invective.
