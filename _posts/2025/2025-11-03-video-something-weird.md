I am going to step out of my lane again and tout this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX7PdJIGiCw">Something Weird Happens When You Simulate Lifeless Molecules</a>, by Veritasium. What happens is that you get (simulated) life, natural selection, and so on. Professional biologists will no doubt find something to carp about. I did not especially like the term, "survival of the fittest," when I think he really meant "natural selection." My first impression was that he may have been conflating origin of life with evolution, though they are certainly closely related. He kind of pushes the selfish gene theory, but also states some criticisms and states flatly that genetic drift can sometimes overcome natural selection. He notes that his model is an oversimplification, but then, as he says, all scientific models are oversimplifications. I will let a real biologist discuss whether evolution takes place at the level of the gene, the individual, or indeed the group. As for me, I thought it was a splendid video which in a half-hour or so gave a clear understanding of how life can develop from non-life and go on to evolve into, well, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful, several of which make cameo appearances in the video.
