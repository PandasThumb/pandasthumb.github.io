<figcaption><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_darter">Anhinga melanogaster</a></i> &ndash; oriental darter, Keoladeo National Park, Rajasthan, India. Mr. Harshman writes, "Immature bird sunning and preening with a background of duckweed. There are four species in the family Anhingidae, and they are all nearly identical. I particularly like the way the curved neck shows the cervical vertebrae so clearly."
