Do not let the date fool you: I have had them in a below-grade bathroom since I brought them home from Nist on a backpack, probably in the 1990's. It is what you get for working in a building that was put up during the Eisenhower administration. Mostly I do not see them in the rest of the house, but this one decided to hang around on a plate in the kitchen, apparently begging to be photographed.
