<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Day">Darwin Day</a>, variously known, I think, as Evolution Day and later Evolution Weekend and <a href="https://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rasweekend2025.html">Religion and Science Weekend</a>, commemorates Darwin's birthday on February 12, 1809 (yes, the same day as Abraham Lincoln). 

The National Center for Science Education warns us that <a href="https://ncse.ngo/darwin-day-2025-approaches">Darwin Day approaches</a> and announces:
<blockquote> For its part, NCSE, with the National Association of Biology Teachers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qNWW6NRfjE">Katie Hinde</a>, will be reprising the popular evolution symposium "A Lioness Walks Into an Orca: How Stories Enhance Science Education" and sharing exciting information about the 2025 March Mammal Madness tournament online at 7:00 p.m. Eastern on February 12, 2025 (details to be announced). And of course, NCSE will be active on social media in support of evolution education — look for (and use) the hashtag #whyteachevolution on Darwin Day, and check out our #whyteachevolution <a href="https://ncse.ngo/why-teach-evolution-2020">essays</a>. </blockquote>

I had to search a little harder to find other events.  Here they come:

<a href="https://www.evolutionmeetings.org">Evolution 2025</a> is the joint meeting of the American Society of Naturalists, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the Society for the Study of Evolution.  The meeting is one of the premiere international opportunities for sharing research on evolutionary biology. "The conference will be held in 2 parts:  A 2 day virtual conference with live online workshops, talks, symposia, and networking events May 29-30, followed a few weeks later by a 5 day in-person conference in Athens, GA, USA at the Classic Center, June 20-24, 2025."
