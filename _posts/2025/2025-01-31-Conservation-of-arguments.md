William Dembski has recently made two posts ([here]() and [here]() at
Evolution News, the advocacy site of the Discovery Institute's Center for 
Science and Culture.  He describes them as sections of a paper he 
submitted to the DI's house journal BIO-Complexity.  The paper was not

sections at EN.
