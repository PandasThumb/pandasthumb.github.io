Once again, it is the birthday (August 1st) of Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de 
Lamarck.  He was the first evolutionary major biologist (as far as I am concerned).  He drew some of 
the first evolutionary trees, and suggested mechanisms for evolution, including adaptation. (His mechanisms 
were wrong, of course).  He was also a major pioneer of invertebrate biology.

On past birthdays I have covered many aspects of Lamarck's life and work, down to and including the 
avenue and Paris Metro station named after him.  This time, allow me to digrees to the life of 
his patron Buffon, who also has a claim to be an early evolutionist.

Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788) was a sometime-aristocrat who was 
interested in many scientific and mathematical questions.  Among other investigations, he had 
his employees measure the rate of cooling of a metal sphere after it was taken out of a 
furnace, and from this estimated the age of the Earth as almost 75,000 years.  This is much 
more than the biblical figure.

He was most famous for writing a 39-volume _Histoire Naturelle_ which surveyed many 
aspects of natural history, and was widely read.  In the course of this, he raised the issue of evolutionary 
change, and argued that it was due to degeneration of forms from an original continuum of 
life.  He was actually forced by Paris academicians to recant his views because they 
conflicted with the biblical account.  He gave no mechanism for the evolution of adaptation, 
however.

His connection with Lamarck was direct.  When Lamarck started writing on the flora of 
France, Buffon, who was head of the royal botanical garden, was impressed and gave him 
a job there.  When I visited the garden, which now contains the museum of natural 
history as well, I saw an impressive 18th century mansion there.  On it was a 
plaque announcing that Buffon has lived in it and had died there, and so had Lamarck.

Without Buffon, Lamarck would probably not have accomplished much of what he did. 
Perhaps Buffon's cleverest achievement was that he died one year before the start 
of the French Revolution.  So here's a toast to Buffon, and thus indirectly to Lamarck.
