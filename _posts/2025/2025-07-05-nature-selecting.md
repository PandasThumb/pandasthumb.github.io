This post is an unashamed plug for the book <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/mns/news-and-publications/chakrabarty_evolution.pdf">Nature Selecting</a>, subtitled "A children's book explaining evolution," by Prosanta Chakrabarty, professor of biology and curator of fish at Louisiana State University, and illustrated by Anjai Noël, who just graduated from Sherwood Middle School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is Prof. Chakrabarty's 14-year-old daughter. The book cover, left, shows one of Ms. Noël's delightful illustrations. Prof. Chakrabarty is also the author of the 2023 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explaining-through-Evolution-Prosanta-Chakrabarty/dp/0262546256/">Explaining Life through Evolution</a>.


As far as I can tell, the present work, Nature Selecting, is available only as a PDF and at no cost. It is worth much more than that, and I hope they will eventually print it on paper.
