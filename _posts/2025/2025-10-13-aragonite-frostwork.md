<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthodite">Aragonite frostwork</a>, taken in a cave in Nevada during field work. Mr. Rice writes, "<i>Anthodites</i> are speleothems (cave formations) composed of long needle-like crystals situated in clusters which radiate outward from a common base. Most anthodites are made of the mineral aragonite (a variety of calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>), although some are composed of gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>Â·2H<sub>2</sub>O).  The "needles" may be quill-like or feathery."
