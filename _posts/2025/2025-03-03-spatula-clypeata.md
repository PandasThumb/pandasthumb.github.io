<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Shoveler/overview"><i>Spatula clypeata</i></a> &ndash; northern shoveler, East Boulder (Colorado) Community Center, February, 2025. It was hard to get a halfway decent picture of this pair, because they kept swimming around in circles with their bills in the water, almost as if they were filter feeding. According to the link, in fact they <i>were</i> filter feeding: "Shovelers eat tiny crustaceans, other aquatic invertebrates, and seeds which they filter out of the water with comblike projections (called lamellae) along the edge of the bill." You may see a nice picture of the lamellae <a href="https://roadsendnaturalist.com/2016/02/24/meandering-at-mattamuskeet/">here</a>.
