Mr. Denelsbeck writes that this anole "regrew its detached tail, but forked &ndash; I've seen photos but this was the first that I'd found an example of myself, right on the downspout by the front door last November [2023]. Unfortunately, despite keeping a wary eye out, I have not spotted it since. Based on some scarring, this might have been the same one that I found without a tail back in April of that year, which if true, would give a rough time frame of how long it takes to regrow. Canon 7D, Canon 18-135 STM, handheld, cropped."
