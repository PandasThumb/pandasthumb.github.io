In case you missed it, Skeptical Inquirer Presents has posted <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/video/evolution-education-a-century-of-scopes-john-de-lancie-and-eugenie-scott/">Evolution, Education, and a Century of Scopes</a>, a discussion anticipating the <a href="https://centerforinquiry.org/scopes-trial-centennial-conference/">Scopes Trial Centennial conference</a> in Chattanooga, Tennessee, this summer. The discussants are Eugenie Scott, the former executive director of the National Center for Science Education and an expert on creationism vs. evolution, and the actor John de Lancie, who most recently toured the US with a show on the Scopes Monkey Trial and subsequently co-authored an audio play, <i>The Dover Intelligent Design Trial</i>. Mr. de Lancie was awarded the Clarence Darrow Award in 2018. The video is over an hour long, but I thought it was well worth watching.
