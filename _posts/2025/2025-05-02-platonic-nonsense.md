The Discovery Institute's "Evolution News" is always a great place to look for tenuous and dubious arguments against evolutionary 
biology.  Lately they have been touting a book by EN journalist David Klinghoffer, published by Discovery Press, 
the DI's house publisher.  The book is "[Platoâ€™s Revenge: The New Science of the Immaterial Genome](https://discovery.press/b/platos-revenge/)".   Emily Sandico, a DI staff writer, has [a piece calling attention to the book]( https://evolutionnews.org/2025/04/platos-revenge-intelligent-design-in-real-time/).

The book by Klinghoffer describes the views of Richard Sternberg.  Sternberg has two 
Ph.D. degrees, one in molecular evolution and another in systems science.  His
own web page ([here](https://richardsternberg.com/))






which she calls "intelligent design in real time".
