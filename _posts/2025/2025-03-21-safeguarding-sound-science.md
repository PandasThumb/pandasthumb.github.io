Safeguarding Sound Science combats misinformation, disinformation, and misconceptions about climate change with actual science. In the 7-episode <a href="https://ncse.ngo/safeguarding-sound-science">Season One: Climate Change Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/profiles/mat-kaplan">Mat Kaplan</a> (Senior Communications Advisor of the <a href="https://www.planetary.org/">Planetary Society</a> and former host of <a href="https://www.planetary.org/planetary-radio">Planetary Radio</a>) talks to scientists, teachers, and other experts to explore who's behind some of the more insidious efforts to sow distrust in climate science, how those efforts filter down to schools and classrooms, and what is being done to ensure that everyone — especially students — is exposed to accurate climate science.

As of this writing, the first two installments have been posted: Episode 1: "What Climate Change? Tackling Climate Denial," with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mann"> Michael Mann</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Branch">Glenn Branch</a> of the National Center for Science Education; and Episode 2: "A Century of Disinformation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes">Naomi Oreskes</a> and the Merchants of Doubt," with Mat Kaplan.
