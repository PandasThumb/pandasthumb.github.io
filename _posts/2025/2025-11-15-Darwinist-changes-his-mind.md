The Discovery Institute's website "Science and Culture" (formerly Evolution 
News and Views) had a dramatic story of conversion recently.  A post 
entitled "He Taught Darwinism for Decades (Then Changed His Mind)" by
Andrew McDiarmid on 30 October 2025  





> For decades, British professor and author Neil Thomas was a card-carrying Darwinist. It wasn’t until after he retired from academia that he had the repose to think about things objectively. 
Then one day, in a scientific flash of inspiration, he came to the conclusion that the standard Darwinian story was “rubbish.”
