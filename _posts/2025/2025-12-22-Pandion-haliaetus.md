<figcaption><i><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Osprey/">Pandion haliaetus</a></i>, another contribution from Al Denelsbeck, who writes, "Osprey, with unidentified fish prey. Being tremendously cooperative, this osprey turned towards me while climbing up very slowly with a capture near its lifting limit. After diving for fish, osprey always gain a few meters of altitude before giving a big shimmy to rid their feathers of excess water, usually losing a little altitude when doing so, and that's what's happening here. This was beyond nesting season, so this osprey might have had the meal all to itself. Canon 7D, Tamron SP 150-600&nbsp;mm at 600&nbsp;mm, handheld, cropped tightly."
