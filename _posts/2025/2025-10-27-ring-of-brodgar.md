<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Brodgar">Ring of Brodgar</a>, Mainland Island, Orkney Islands, Scotland, May 21, 2023. Mr. Long writes, "This is part of the Orkney Neolithic Complex recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  It is unusual in having a ring of standing stones (27 at present, of 60 originally) associated with a henge.  Age is estimated as 2000-2500 BCE on poor data.  The fact that it is the northernmost henge and stone circle in Great Britain may be understood by reference to a map; little of Great Britain is farther north.  Technical: Olympus OM-D EM-1 Mark III, Olympus 12-40 mm, f/2.8 at 27 mm, 1/60 s, f/16, ISO 200, handheld."
