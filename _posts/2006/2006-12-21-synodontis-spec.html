  <p align="left">Regular readers of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/">my own blog</a> may remember that I have a softspot for tropical catfish. The genus <em>Synodontis</em> (Cuvier 1816) is interesting for a number of reasons. For example, <em><a href="http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=9596"><font color="#669966">S. multipunctatus</font></a></em> (the gorgeous fish pictured above) is the only fish known to practice brood parasitism: it manages to mix it eggs with those of mouthbrooding cichlids in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>, its larvae grow faster than those of the host and feed on them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">Lake Tanganyika is, of course, famous for the cichlids which have been studied as an example of a rapid, recent radiation which was caused by environmental change (in this case, fluctuations in water level). It is also home to to other endemic fauna, including ten species of <em>Synodontis</em>. A recent study has used mitochondrial DNA to study the history of the genus in the region.
