_Note: Matt Young directed the selection of the finalists and wrote most of this text._

We received approximately 60 photographs from 20 photographers.  Most of the pictures were excellent.  Approximately half represented endangered or invasive species, very loosely defined. We therefore established 3 categories: general, threatened or endangered, and invasive. 

Choosing finalists was difficult. We considered what we thought was the scientific and pictorial qualities of the photographs, and also attempted to represent as many photographers and present as much variety as possible.

Here are the finalists in the _general_ category. The text was written by the photographers and lightly edited for style.  Please look through them before voting for your favorite.  We know it is possible to game these polls.  Please act like adults and don't vote more than once.  If we believe that the results are invalid, the contest will be canceled.  The photos and poll are below the fold.

The [Talk Origins Archive Foundation](http://www.talkorigins.org/foundation/donate.html) will provide the winner with an autographed copy of _Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)_, by Matt Young and Paul Strode?

<div class="panel-overlay">
<i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_anole">green anole</a>, by Al Denelsbeck &mdash;  Not endangered or even threatened at this point, they nevertheless are getting crowded out in Florida by the introduced and more aggressive brown anole. Florida seems to play host to more introduced species than any state I'm aware of. I was glad to capture the wide color variation of the species in one shot.

<div class="panel-overlay">
<i>Gonatodes ocellatus</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonatodes">ocellated gecko</a>, adult male by Daniel Scantlebury &mdash;  This species is found only on rocky slopes on Tobago and Little Tobago Island.  Fortunately, its status is secure for now, because it is abundant (although secretive) and protected by the oldest rainforest preserve in the Western Hemisphere.
