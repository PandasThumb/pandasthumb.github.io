  <p>In an <a href="http://www.texanonline.net/default.asp?action=article&amp;aid=5527&amp;issue=1/28/2008">article</a> by the Southern Baptist Texan, Dembski describes why people should be watching ‘Expelled’. And no it is not because of the suppression of the ‘science’ of intelligent design, no, no no. It’s all about the idea that there is a “…Darwinian, atheistic mafia whose purpose is to ruin the careers of anybody who delves into the idea of intelligent design.”</p>

<p>Not surprisingly he argues (sic) that:</p>

<p>Dembski wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dembski told the Southern Baptist TEXAN that those who most need to see the movie are “parents of children in high school or college, as well as those children themselves, who may think that the biological sciences are a dispassionate search for truth about life but many of whose practitioners see biology, especially evolutionary biology, as an ideological weapon to destroy faith in God.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>St Augustine explained it well when he stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.</strong> The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. [1 Timothy 1.7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has nothing to do with the scientific accuracy of evolutionary theory but all with destroying Darwinism at all cost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Craft added, “I think the public, once they understand more and more what Darwinian evolution represents, I think they will reject that and move against it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How sad.</p>

<p>However, on a brighter note, PZ Myers is named in the same sentence as Richard Dawkins</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’ll notice, big science is trying to squash the talking about God in academia. People say ID is religion dressed up in a cheap tuxedo. Well, big science is atheism dressed up in a cheap tuxedo. Their motivation when you scratch the surface is so unreal in terms of propagating their atheism. Richard Dawkins and P.Z. Myers [noted atheistic evolutionists], they are chilling in what they are trying to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chilling indeed how they confront ID proponents face to face and destroy their arguments…</p>

<p>On an even brighter note ID seems to have abandoned attempts to become scientifically relevant and instead is following in the footsteps of other creationist movements to argue that science, and especially biological science is inherently atheistic.</p>

<p>What a crock. We Christians have nothing to fear from science but science itself. When we reject science because it does not agree with our Faith then both lose.</p>
