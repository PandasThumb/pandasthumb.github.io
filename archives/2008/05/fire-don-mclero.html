  <p class="lead">Don McLeroy is the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/at_least_don_mcleroy_is_consis.php">deranged</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/12/did_you_all_catch_comer_on_sci.php">creationist</a> dentist who was appointed to the chairmanship of the Texas State Board of Education, and who is responsible for the recent <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/11/the_real_scoop_on_the_texas_sc.php">purge and intimidation</a> of people who support good biology &mdash; he's trouble all the way through. Take a look at his <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D90RHOOG0.html">latest stunt</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The State Board of Education's debate on new English and reading standards took another rowdy turn Friday as members approved a never-before-seen version of the lengthy document which materialized less than an hour before the board was to take a final vote.</p><p>After a wacky and terse debate on the new curriculum, the board voted 9-6 in favor of the new version, which will remain in place for the next decade and sets standards for state tests and textbooks, as well as classroom teaching.</p><p>Experts and teachers have been working on the new curriculum standards for two and a half years.</p><p>"I find it's really wild that we can work for three years on a project and then the board is so qualified they can pull it out of their hat overnight," said board member Pat Hardy, a Fort Worth Republican who, like other board members, received the substituted document when it was slipped under her hotel door less than an hour before their meeting was set to convene Friday morning.</p><p>Some social conservatives on the board prepared the latest version overnight.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is similar to what our former education commissioner for Minnesota, Cheri Yecke, tried to pull &mdash; she tried to swap in a 'minority report' for the state science standards that was composed behind the back of the official committee &hellip; only McLeroy has outdone her by an order of magnitude or so. Why even bring in qualified educators and scientists to do the hard work of a standards committee if you're just going to throw their work away and replace it with some hack job done by ideologues overnight? And to give it to them for review an hour before the meeting is just plain insulting.</p>

<p>This is for the <i>English</i> standards. What kind of circus are we going to see in response to the upcoming science standards?</p>

<p>At least one <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5793570.html">board of education member is calling for McLeroy's ejection</a>, although it sounds like she doesn't expect anything to come of it. This is what we can expect of creationist conservatives: a dictatorship of the incompetent.</p>
