  <p>On <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/another_junk_dna_denialist_on.php">Pharyngula</a>, PZ Myers shows how Intelligent Design continues to be a scientifically vacuous concept.</p>

<p>Desperate to show that evolution can be detrimental to scientific inquiry, ID proponents have been arguing not only that junk dna was a prediction by ID, a statement which is logically flawed, but also that evolution and particularly Darwinism was the reason why people called non-coding DNA and pseudogenes ‘junk’.</p>

<p>The latter assertion has been more than once corrected on this blog but it seems that ID remains dogmatic in its claims, unable to learn from its own mistakes.</p>

<p>The same applies to the creationist understanding of the meaning of vestigial which they somehow believe to be equivalent to ‘no function’.</p>

<p>Wikipedia explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vestigiality describes homologous characters of organisms which have lost all or most of their original function in a species through evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Original function…</p>

<p>As PZ Myers points out Junk DNA was a concept that arose out of the concept of neutral evolution. In fact, Darwinian theory would expect non-functional DNA to not be conserved in any form or manner. But that’s not where our poor ID proponent stops, he then continues to argue that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not big into counting genes, especially as regulatory regions (you know - “Junk DNA”) seem to be as important as the genes themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However anyone familiar with the history of genetics would know that regulatory genes were never considered to be Junk DNA. How wrong can one be?</p>

<p>Is this truly the best ID has to offer? In that case it should be self evident that teaching the controversy becomes nothing more than a mindless repetition of past ignorant claims of creationists who had little respect for history.</p>

<p>Let this be a warning to educators and parents foolish enough to promote the teaching of ‘alternative theories’ of evolution or ‘controversies’ in evolutionary theory.</p>

<p>It’s also not true that science ignored junk DNA, in fact as <a href="http://adaptivecomplexity.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-confusion-about-junk-dna-and.html">this posting</a> points out science has been studying Junk DNA for quite some time and in doing so discovered novel potential roles for some Junk DNA.</p>

<p>And finally for those interested in more on this topic, read Larry Moran’s <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/06/wired-on-junk-dna.html">contributions</a> and be sure to follow the links in the article. Poor Larry has been busy correcting <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2006/12/idiots-dont-understand-junk-dna.html">many misconceptions</a> by ID proponents on this topic. Seems he will not likely be out of a job soon… Larry also notes how Bill Dembski got it all wrong. Perhaps <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2006/11/bill-dembski-needs-help-again.html">Dembski’s flawed comments</a> have caused the present case of ID ignorance?</p>

<p>Such is the contribution of ID to science, more ignorance.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Fortunately, there are some smart people who post comments on Uncommon Descent. They have told Bill that the concept of junk DNA is explicitly non-Darwinian. It was proposed by scientists who didn’t feel the need to explain everything as an adaptation.</p>

  <p>I don’t know how many times we’ve explained to Bill that not all evolutionary biologists are “Darwinists.” I know I first told him four years ago but I’m sure there were others before me. He seems to be a very slow learner.</p>

<p>It seems that Dembski may not be the only slow learner here.</p>
