  <p><img src="/uploads/2008/NYTLogo.jpg" alt="NYTLogo.jpg" width="50" height="40" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" class="mt-image-left" />In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/us/04evolution.html">Opponents of Evolution Adopting a New Strategy </a>, Laura Beil explores the tactics by Intelligent Design Creationists to undermine the teaching of science.  This time, their focus is on Texas where Creationists have a close majority on the State Education Board.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opponents of teaching evolution, in a natural selection of sorts, have gradually shed those strategies that have not survived the courts. Over the last decade, creationism has given rise to “creation science,” which became “intelligent design,” which in 2005 was banned from the public school curriculum in Pennsylvania by a federal judge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual creationists are inconsistent and expose the true motives behind ‘teaching the controversy’</p>

<p>McLeroy wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chairman of the state education board, Dr. Don McLeroy, a dentist in Central Texas, denies that the phrase “is subterfuge for bringing in creationism.”</p>

  <p>“Why in the world would anybody not want to include weaknesses?” Dr. McLeroy said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>versus</p>

<p>McLeroy wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. McLeroy, the board chairman, sees the debate as being between “two systems of science.”</p>

  <p>“You’ve got a creationist system and a naturalist system,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems that ID Creationists are insisting on looking ‘foolish’ undermining both science and religious faith. As  Augustine (A.D. 354-430) in his work “The Literal Meaning of Genesis” observed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. <strong>Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.</strong> The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. <strong>If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason?</strong> Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McLeroy however, foolishly maintains that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. McLeroy believes that Earth’s appearance is a recent geologic event — thousands of years old, not 4.5 billion. “I believe a lot of incredible things,” he said, “The most incredible thing I believe is the Christmas story. That little baby born in the manger was the god that created the universe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, he maintains, following the talking points of the ID movement, that ID has nothing to do with his personal faith.</p>

<p>Yes, McLeroy surely knows how to make us Christians look foolish.</p>
