  <li>Expelled opens in Lawrence today.  The newspaper gives it one star out of four, offering this review:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Droning funnyman Ben Stein monkeys around with evolution with the new documentary, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, a cynical attempt to sucker Christian conservatives into thinking they’re losing the “intelligent design” debate because of academic “prejudice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>On the other side of the scale, the Intelligent Design network sent an email to many teachers and others in public education in the Kansas City area, saying, in part:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Friday, April 18th, is FREEDOM FRIDAY!</p>

  <p>You will no longer have to live in fear of the Darwinian Thought Police and their power to ruin your career! They are about to be ‘publicly exposed’ by the new documentary movie, “EXPELLED: No Intelligence Allowed”!</p>

  <p>“EXPELLED,” starring Ben Stein, is opening in 1,000 theaters nationwide. Smart students and their parents can’t wait to see it! They have all heard the Darwinists’ side in the debate over origins. Now they will determine if the Darwinists have acted properly by censoring the scientific data and evidence from students, teachers and parents that opposes Darwinian evolution and points to the reality of God!</p>

  <p>Have you ever wondered about the scientific validity of the major proofs of evolution?</p>

  <p>Have you ever wondered what the controversy over the teaching of origins science is really about?</p>

  <p>Have you wondered why Darwinists will not allow origins science to be taught objectively?</p>

  <p>Have you wondered if scientists have found evidence for God?</p>

  <p>Have you ever fully understood why you have this fear of mentioning God in the classroom?</p>

  <p>If your answer to any of these questions is ‘yes’, then this earth-shattering documentary will open your eyes to the cover-up of the century!</p>

  <p>Students, teachers, and parents will now see and hear the other side of the story as they view “EXPELLED: No Intelligence Allowed”. They will begin to draw new conclusions for themselves about the “thought police” as well as the most important question they will ever try to answer: Where did I come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talk about hyperbolic rhetoric - this takes the cake: “FREEDOM FRIDAY”, “Darwinian Thought Police”, “cover-up of the century!”.  What reasonable person could take these overblown pronouncements seriously?</p>

<p>And how about “scientific data and evidence … that points to the reality of God!”</p>

<p>It seems to me that Expelled has blown the last vestiges of the ID movement’s attempt to pretend that they are just about science, and no religion is involved.  Of course we’ve known all along that the goal of the ID movement, as Philip Johnson has explained, has been to show that “‘In the Beginning was the Word’ is as true scientifically as it is Biblically,” but Expelled and its promotion now spills that premise out in public on the big screen.</p>
