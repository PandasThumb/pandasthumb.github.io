  <p>The Florida legislature is considering an “Academic Freedom Act” originating from Disco. For some background see my <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/03/explore-the-str.html">earlier post</a>.</p>

<p>The bill has passed its first <a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=516">committee vote</a> with amendments.  The amended bill starts as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee on Education Pre-K - 12 (Wise) recommended the<br />
following amendment:</p>

  <p>2</p>

  <p>3</p>

  <p>4 Senate Amendment (with title amendment)</p>

  <p>5 Delete everything after the enacting clause</p>

  <p>6 and insert:</p>

  <p>7 Section 1. (1) This section may be cited as the “Evolution</p>

  <p>8 Academic Freedom Act.”</p>

  <p>9 (2) As used in this section, the term “scientific</p>

  <p>10 information” means germane current facts, data, and peer-reviewed</p>

  <p>11 research specific to the topic of chemical and biological</p>

  <p>12 evolution as prescribed in Florida’s Science Standards.</p>

  <p>13 (3) The Legislature finds that current law does not</p>

  <p>14 expressly protect the right of teachers to objectively present</p>

  <p>15 scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific</p>

  <p>16 views regarding chemical and biological evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Disco is not on trial at the moment, they claim the following “Peer-Reviewed &amp; Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated)”:
<a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2640">Discovery Institute claims peer reviewed support.</a></p>

<p>And as regular readers know, they quote mine much of the rest of the scientific literature to read it as they wish.</p>

<p>The entire Florida bill is reproduced below the fold.  I have a simple question for readers: how pleased (or not) is Disco with the revised bill, and why?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee on Education Pre-K - 12 (Wise) recommended the
following amendment:</p>

  <p>2</p>

  <p>3</p>

  <p>4 Senate Amendment (with title amendment)</p>

  <p>5 Delete everything after the enacting clause</p>

  <p>6 and insert:</p>

  <p>7 Section 1. (1) This section may be cited as the “Evolution</p>

  <p>8 Academic Freedom Act.”</p>

  <p>9 (2) As used in this section, the term “scientific</p>

  <p>10 information” means germane current facts, data, and peer-reviewed</p>

  <p>11 research specific to the topic of chemical and biological</p>

  <p>12 evolution as prescribed in Florida’s Science Standards.</p>

  <p>13 (3) The Legislature finds that current law does not</p>

  <p>14 expressly protect the right of teachers to objectively present</p>

  <p>15 scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific</p>

  <p>16 views regarding chemical and biological evolution. The</p>

  <p>17 Legislature finds that in many instances educators have</p>

  <p>18 experienced or feared discipline, discrimination, or other</p>

  <p>19 adverse consequences as a result of presenting the full range of</p>

  <p>20 scientific views regarding chemical and biological evolution. The</p>

  <p>21 Legislature further finds that existing law does not expressly</p>

  <p>22 protect students from discrimination due to their positions or</p>

  <p>23 views regarding biological or chemical evolution. The Legislature</p>

  <p>24 finds that the topic of biological and chemical evolution has</p>

  <p>25 generated intense controversy about the rights of teachers and</p>

  <p>26 students to hold differing views on those subjects. It is</p>

  <p>27 therefore the intent of the Legislature that this section</p>

  <p>28 expressly protect those rights.</p>

  <p>29 (4) Every public school teacher in the state’s K-12 school</p>

  <p>30 system shall have the affirmative right and freedom to</p>

  <p>31 objectively present scientific information relevant to the full</p>

  <p>32 range of scientific views regarding biological and chemical</p>

  <p>33 evolution in connection with teaching any prescribed curriculum</p>

  <p>34 regarding chemical or biological evolution.</p>

  <p>35 (5) A public school teacher in the state’s K-12 school</p>

  <p>36 system may not be disciplined, denied tenure, terminated, or</p>

  <p>37 otherwise discriminated against for objectively presenting</p>

  <p>38 scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific</p>

  <p>39 views regarding biological or chemical evolution in connection</p>

  <p>40 with teaching any prescribed curriculum regarding chemical or</p>

  <p>41 biological evolution.</p>

  <p>42 (6) Public school students in the state’s K-12 school</p>

  <p>43 system shall be evaluated based upon their understanding of</p>

  <p>44 course materials through normal testing procedures. However,</p>

  <p>45 students shall not be penalized for subscribing to a particular</p>

  <p>46 position or view regarding biological or chemical evolution.</p>

  <p>47 (7) The rights and privileges contained in this section</p>

  <p>48 apply when the subject of biological or chemical evolution is</p>

  <p>49 part of the curriculum. This section does not require or</p>

  <p>50 encourage any change in the state curriculum standards for the K-</p>

  <p>51 12 public school system.</p>

  <p>52 (8) This section does not promote any religious doctrine,</p>

  <p>53 promote discrimination for or against a particular set of</p>

  <p>54 religious beliefs, or promote discrimination for or against</p>

  <p>55 religion or nonreligion.</p>

  <p>56 Section 2. This act shall take effect October 1, 2008.</p>

  <p>57</p>

  <p>58</p>

  <p>59 ================ T I T L E A M E N D M E N T ================</p>

  <p>60 And the title is amended as follows:</p>

  <p>61</p>

  <p>62 Delete everything before the enacting clause</p>

  <p>63 and insert:</p>

  <p>64 A bill to be entitled</p>

  <p>65 An act relating to teaching chemical and biological</p>

  <p>66 evolution; providing a short title; providing legislative</p>

  <p>67 intent; defining the term “scientific information”;</p>

  <p>68 providing public school teachers with a right to present</p>

  <p>69 scientific information relevant to the full range of views</p>

  <p>70 on biological and chemical evolution; prohibiting a</p>

  <p>71 teacher from being discriminated against for presenting</p>

  <p>72 such information; prohibiting students from being</p>

  <p>73 penalized for subscribing to a particular position on</p>

  <p>74 evolution; clarifying that the act does not require any</p>

  <p>75 change in state curriculum standards or promote any</p>

  <p>76 religious position; providing an effective date.</p>
