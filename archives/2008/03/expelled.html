  <p class="lead">There is a rich, deep kind of irony that must be shared. I'm blogging this from the Apple store in the Mall of America, because I'm too amused to want to wait until I get back to my hotel room.</p>

<p>I went to attend a screening of the creationist propaganda movie, <i>Expelled</i>, a few minutes ago. Well, I <b>tried</b> &hellip; but I was <b>Expelled</b>! It was kind of weird &mdash; I was standing in line, hadn't even gotten to the point where I had to sign in and show ID, and a policeman pulled me out of line and told me I could not go in. I asked why, of course, and he said that a producer of the film had specifically instructed him that I was not to be allowed to attend. The officer also told me that if I tried to go in, I would be arrested. I assured him that I wasn't going to cause any trouble.</p>

<p>I went back to my family and talked with them for a while, and then the officer came back with a theater manager, and I was told that not only wasn't I allowed in, but I had to leave the premises <i>immediately</i>. Like right that instant.</p>

<p>I complied.</p>

<p>I'm still laughing though. You don't know how hilarious this is. Not only is it the extreme hypocrisy of being expelled from their <i>Expelled</i> movie, but there's another layer of amusement. Deep, belly laugh funny. Yeah, I'd be rolling around on the floor right now, if I weren't so dang dignified.</p>

<p>You see &hellip; well, have you ever heard of a sabot? It's a kind of sleeve or lightweight carrier used to surround a piece of munition fired from a gun. It isn't the actually load intended to strike the target, but may even be discarded as it leaves the barrel.</p>

<p>I'm a kind of sabot right now.</p>

<p>They singled me out and evicted <b>me</b>, but they didn't notice my guest. They let him go in escorted by my wife and daughter. I guess they didn't recognize him. My guest was &hellip;</p>

<p><i><b>Richard Dawkins</b></i>.</p>

<p>He's in the theater right now, watching their movie.</p>

<p>Tell me, are you laughing as hard as I am?</p>
