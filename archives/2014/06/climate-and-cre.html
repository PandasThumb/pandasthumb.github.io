  <p>The economist Paul Krugman has come to the “somewhat surprising conclusion” that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/opinion/krugman-interests-ideology-and-climate.html"> global warming denial is not mainly about vested economic interests </a> but rather asks us to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>think about global warming from the point of view of someone who grew up taking Ayn Rand seriously, believing that the untrammeled pursuit of self-interest is always good and that government is always the problem, never the solution. Along come some scientists declaring that unrestricted pursuit of self-interest will destroy the world, and that government intervention is the only answer. It doesn't matter how market-friendly you make the proposed intervention; this is a direct challenge to the libertarian worldview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not want to be flip, but almost any reader of PT could have told him that; just substitute “Book of Genesis” in place of “Ayn Rand,” make other substitutions as necessary, and you will see what I mean. If Krugman is right, and I am sure that he is, he brings bad news: People will deny global warming with their last breath, and they will not be convinced even by a mountain of evidence or the testimony of the vast majority of experts.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is far more money behind global-warming denial than behind evolution denial, and denialists will fight even quintessentially conservative solutions like cap and trade until, as <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/03/4156267/on-climate-change-obamas-action.html">the columnist Leonard Pitts put it today</a>, the west Antarctic ice sheet falls into the ocean and our grandchildren vie for beachfront property in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Note added approximately 2:50 MDT:  See also an <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/09/1305502/-Krugman-examines-the-real-opposition-to-acting-on-global-climate-change">article in the Daily Kos</a> linking David Koch to climate-change denial. Mr. Koch, according to the author,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>understands the way anti-scientism can be used to fuel a political pushback against science as a mean of undermining support for government regulation.  That the science clashes with his economic interests gives him and his brother the motivation [opportunity?] to use their wealth to try to shape the political processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, I was reminded of a comment that Jared Diamond made during a talk, roughly, “The person who cut down the last date palm tree on Easter Island was probably calling for another study.”</p>
