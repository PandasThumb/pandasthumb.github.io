<p>Well, AiG’s Ken Ham has seen the movie “Noah” starring Russell Crowe, and boy, <a href="http://tnchristiannews.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/ken-ham-calls-noah-movie-paganistic-and-evil/">is he steamed</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Friends, I just arrived home after seeing the Hollywood (Paramount) movie NOAH tonight. It is MUCH much worse than I thought it would be. Much worse.</p>

  <p>The Director of the movie, Darren Aronofsky has been quoted in the media as saying NOAH is ‘the least biblical biblical film ever made’, I agree wholeheartedly with him.</p>

  <p>I am disgusted. I am going to come right out and say it-it is disgusting and evil-paganism! Do you really want your family to see a pagan movie the has Noah as some psychopath who says if his daughter-in-law’s baby is a girl, he will kill it as soon as it’s born. And then when two girls are born, bloodstained Noah (the man the Bible calls righteous Noah-Genesis 7:1), brings a knife down to one of the baby’s heads to kill it and at the last minute doesn’t do it-and then a bit later says he failed because he didn’t kill the babies. How can we recommend this movie and then speak against abortion! Psychopathic Noah sees humans as a blight on the planet and wants to rid the world of people.</p>

  <p>I feel dirty-as if I have to somehow wash the evil off me.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot believe there are Christian leaders who have recommended people see this movie.</p>

  <p>It’s as if someone heard the name Noah, that there was a Flood and and Ark and then made a pagan movie up about it. I don’t think there is anything else that really has to do with the Bible’s account except some names of people! Methuselah is some sort of witchdoctor who can do magical things.</p>

  <p>There is so much more I could say about it-so much more. And what’s with the bizarre fallen angels being living rocks helping Noah??</p>

  <p>I suggest you join us tomorrow night for our live stream at 8 pm EST. A number of AiG researches watched the movie tonight and four of us will be on the live stream to explain what we saw and heard.</p>

  <p>I am SO GLAD my wife did not come with me to see this-she would have been terribly upset.</p>

  <p>I feel violated as a Christian.</p>

  <p>Regardless of what others say-I just had to come right out and say this.</p>

  <p>Oh-it is also a boring movie-yes boring! Worst movie I think I’ve ever seen.</p>

  <p>That’s my personal take-join us tomorrow night for our discussion of NOAH.</p>

  <p>The movie begins with (and has the same statement later on):</p>

  <p>‘In there beginning there was nothing’</p>

  <p>The Bible states ‘In the beginning God.’</p>

  <p>That really sums up the difference!</p>
