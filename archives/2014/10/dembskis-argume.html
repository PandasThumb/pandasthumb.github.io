  <p>On August 14, William Dembski spoke at the Computations in Science Seminar at the University of Chicago.  Was this a sign that Dembski’s arguments for intelligent design were being taken seriously by computational scientists?  Did he present new evidence?  There was no new evidence, and the invitation seems to have come from Dembski’s Ph.D. advisor Leo Kadanoff.  I wasn’t present, and you probably weren’t either, but fortunately we can all
view the seminar, as a video of it has been posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN74Vn-R5fg">here</a> on Youtube.</p>

<p>It turns out that Dembski’s current argument is based on two of his previous
papers with Robert Marks (available
<a href="http://marksmannet.com/RobertMarks/REPRINTS/2009_ConservationOfInformationInSearch.pdf">here</a>
and
<a href="http://marksmannet.com/RobertMarks/REPRINTS/2010_TheSearchForASearch.pdf">here</a>) so the arguments are not new.  They involve considering
a simple model of evolution in which we have all possible genotypes, each of 
which has a fitness.  It’s a simple model
of evolution moving uphill on a fitness surface.  Dembski and Marks argue that
substantial evolutionary progress can only be made if the fitness
surface is smooth enough, and that setting up a smooth enough fitness
surface requires a Designer.</p>

<p>Briefly, here’s why I find their argument unconvincing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They conside all possible ways that the set of fitnesses can be
assigned to the set of genotypes.  Almost all of these look like
random assigments of fitnesses to genotypes.</li>
  <li>Given that there is a random association of genotypes and
fitnesses, Dembski is right to assert that it is very hard to make much
progress in evolution.  The fitness surface is a “white noise”
surface that has a vast number of very
sharp peaks.  Evolution will make progress only until it climbs the nearest
peak, and then it will stall.  But …</li>
  <li>That is a very bad model for real biology, because in that case one
mutation is as bad for you as changing all sites in your genome at the same
time!</li>
  <li>Also, in such a model all parts of the genome interact extremely strongly,
much more than they do in real organisms.</li>
  <li>Dembski and Marks acknowledge that if the fitness surface is smoother than that, progress can be made.</li>
  <li>They then argue that choosing a smooth enough fitness surface out of all possible ways of associating the fitnesses with the genotypes requires a Designer.</li>
  <li>But I argue that <strong>the ordinary laws of physics actually imply a surface a lot smoother than a random map of sequences to fitnesses</strong>.  In particular if gene expression is separated in time and space, the genes are much less likely to interact strongly, and the fitness surface will be much smoother
than the “white noise” surface.</li>
  <li>Dembski and Marks implicitly acknowledge, though perhaps just for the sake of argument, that natural selection can create adaptation.  Their
argument does not require design to occur once the fitness surface is
chosen.  It is thus a Theistic Evolution argument rather than one that
argues for Design Intervention.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a lot of argument to bite off in one chew.  Let’s go into more
detail below the fold …</p>

<p>Dembski and Marks’s argument involves defining a new form of information,
showing that it is conserved. Evolution can succeed only if this information
is already present, so therefore evolution does not bring about new
information.  In Dembski’s case he goes on from that to
make a theological argument (in his <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472437853">recent book</a>), which I gather is basically “In the Beginning is the
Information”.</p>

<p>People like to argue about how one ought to define information, but I’m going
to ignore most of those arguments, because I think that there is a simpler
problem that undercuts the Dembski-Marks argument.    My argument here
is not new (it has been
given before at Panda’s Thumb (<a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/a-peer-reviewed.html">here</a> and also <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/a-peer-reviewed-1.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/04/does-csi-enable.html">here</a>).  But with a new wave of publicity for Dembski and Marks’s
argument, it’s worth pointing out in more detail the flaw in their argument.</p>

<p><strong>A typical fitness surface?</strong></p>

<p>Dembski and Marks have a simple model with genotypes and fitnesses. Of course
it is overly simple, but all models are.  It is worth examining, because
if evolution is in trouble in such a model, we need to know why.  Their
computation of information is a measure of how smoothly the fitnesses change
as one moves from one genotype to another, where neighboring genotypes are
those that can be reached from each other by evolutionary
processes such as mutation.  If the fitness is smooth enough, one can find
neighboring genotypes that are better, and the natural selection will tend
to move the population to those.</p>

<p>To figure out how common smooth fitness surfaces are, Dembski and Marks
invoke Bernoulli’s “Principal of Insufficient Reason”.  That basically says
that if we can’t think of a reason to consider probabilities of different
outcomes unequal, we should consider the probabilities all to be equal.
The use of Bernoulli’s Principle underlies all of Dembski and Marks’s
calculations.</p>

<p>In the case of fitness surfaces, the outcomes are all the different
ways that fitnesses can be assigned to genotypes.  So if we have DNA
sequences, and the genome is 1000 bases long, there are 4 x 4 x 4 x … x 4
different genotypes, with 1000 factors of 4 in the product.  That is about 10
raised to the 602nd power.  If each of these possible genotypes
has a different fitness, there are also that many fitness values.   The
Principle of Insufficient Reason says that, lacking any reason to think
otherwise, we should give each of the possible ways that the 10-to-the-602
fitnesses could be assigned to the genotypes an equal chance of being true.</p>

<p>A typical one of this vast number of possibilities has fitnesses
randomly assigned to genotypes.
If that is the case, then when we
change a genotype by making a single mutation in it, we arrive at a new
genotype that has a fitness that is, in effect, chosen from all the possible
fitnesses, at random.</p>

<p><strong>What a mutation does</strong></p>

<p>What if, instead of changing one base, we took the drastic
step of mutating all of the bases in
the genotype at the same time?  If the Bernoulli Principle applied, we
would get to a genotype whose fitness was also chosen at random.  So
in that case, on average,
that would be no better and no worse than changing just one base.
In other words, when fitnesses are randomly assigned to genotypes
<strong>making a single typographical error is exactly as
bad as changing every letter in the text</strong>.</p>

<p>Real biology doesn’t work anything like that.  Making one mutation in one of
my genes will on average make it worse, though sometimes not. If it produces
a protein, a single amino acid change often leaves the protein still
functioning.  But making changes in every site of its DNA is the same as 
replacing every protein by a random string of amino acids.  Which will be a
complete disaster.</p>

<p>Similarly, in statements in English, one typographical error might change
“to be or not to be that is the question” into “to be or not to de that is the
question”.  Changing all letters would give something like
“bdglvwujzib lxmoxg rjdg a ohlowugrbl owj”.  It should be obvious that the
latter is far less functional.  The comprehensibility of English sentences
is more like the actual fitness of organisms, and not like the fitness of
the organisms Dembski and Marks imagine.</p>

<p><strong>Unbelievably strong interactions</strong></p>

<p>In Dembski and Marks’s “white noise” fitness surfaces, another bizarre
property is that every part of the genome interacts incredibly strongly with
every other part.  If they did not interact strongly, we would get cases
like this: we might find
that changing position number 834 in the DNA from C to T would make the genome somewhat
worse.  And changing position 95161 from A to C might also make the genome worse.
If those two positions in the DNA underwent both of these changes at the same time, we could
reasonably expect that this accumulation of two bad changes would be worse yet.</p>

<p>But if the fitnesses are assigned to genotypes at random, that prediction
could not be made.  The double mutant would have a randomly-chosen fitness and
that would have only about a 1/4 chance of being worse than either of the single
mutants.  In fact, about 1/4 of the time it would actually be <em>better</em> than the original
genotype!  We can immediately see that
this could only happen if the two parts of the genome were
tightly interacting in some way.   But in the Dembski-Marks white noise model
<em>all parts of the genome interact tightly with each other</em>.</p>

<p>No real organism works that way.  And there is a simple reason why.</p>

<p><strong>What physics does</strong></p>

<p>The reason is “because physics”.  In the physical laws of our universe,
interaction at a distance gets weaker and weaker as the distance increases.
This is an everyday fact that we rely on all the time.  As I type these
words my fingers and the keys move.  There is an (extremely) slight
gravitational and electrostatic effect of those movements on (say) the
food in your refrigerator.   That effect declines with distance.
As a result, you don’t have to worry that
my typing is busy rearranging the food in your refrigerator.  The eggs will
be right where you left them, and this will not depend on 
whether I type the letter A or the letter B.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the genome, a gene that functions in the growth of your
toenails typically shows no strong interaction with another gene that
controls nerve connections in your ear.  They are physically far from
each other and probably function at different times as well.</p>

<p>In Dembski and Marks’s model universe things don’t work that way. If one
particular
gene has a mutant, we can’t know <em>anything</em> about what its effect is, until
we check all other genes.  A change in any one of those others will
make a major difference in what the effect of the first mutant is.  And
this is not just something that happens occasionally.  It is always true,
for all parts of the genome. Every gene, and every base in every gene,
interacts incredibly tightly with all other bases in all other genes.</p>

<p><strong>Why the white-noise model prevents evolution</strong></p>

<p>The fitness surfaces implicit in Dembski and Marks’s argument are known as
“white noise” fitness surfaces.  White noise has a signal whose values are
uncorrelated from one time to another.  The white noise fitness function
is the same – fitnesses of closely similar genotypes are totally dissimilar.
Knowing the fitness of your genotype simply provides no prediction as to what the fitness will be if the base at one point in your DNA is changed.</p>

<p>Natural selection with mutation and recombination can work its way uphill
on the fitness surface by putting together individually favorable changes.
If the fitness surface does not allow any prediction that such combinations
will often be better than either change alone, then this is a big problem for
evolution. The evolutionary process will frequently get stuck.</p>

<p>Fortunately, “because physics” white noise fitness functions basically
don’t exist.</p>

<p><strong>What Dembski and Marks’s argument doesn’t do</strong></p>

<p>It is notable that Dembski and Marks’s argument is not actually an Intelligent
Design argument.  It argues that a Designer is needed to explain the shape
of the fitness surface, but once that surface
is smooth enough, natural selection and
other evolutionary forces do the rest.  So there is no Design
Intervention needed.</p>

<p><strong>Is evolution a search?  Is it important whether it is?</strong></p>

<p>The audience at Dembski’s talk in Chicago seemed to think that the crucial
issue is whether evolution is or is not a “search”.  Strictly speaking,
in a model of evolution like the one he is using, I think that the answer is
no.  But it actually is not important whether it is or isn’t.  Given the
issue of whether a white noise fitness function is the default, Dembski’s
argument is invalid even if one allows him the point that evolution is a search.</p>

<p><strong>Has this criticism of Dembski’s arguments been made before?</strong></p>

<p>Dembski also used a white noise fitness function in his No Free
Lunch argument, and in the Search For a Search papers he and Marks acknowledge
that connection.  In the No Free Lunch argument the performance of the
search that moves uphill on the fitness surface is extremely poor if averaged
over all possible fitness functions.  This is the same as its behavior
on a typical randomly-chosen fitness function.  At least seven major
criticisms of Dembski’s No Free Lunch argument have objected that white noise
fitness functions are not realistic (links to their articles and posts are
given in my 2007 article and in a summary I wrote <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/criticisms-of-d.html">here</a> at Panda’s Thumb).  The criticism goes back to 2002 and has been voiced by all these authors.</p>

<p><strong>Dieb’s argument with Dembski and Marks’s theorem</strong></p>

<p>Mathematical blogger “Dieb” (Dietmar Eben) has raised the issue (<a href="http://dieben.blogspot.de/2009/10/silent-death-of-horizontal-no-free.html">here</a>, <a href="http://dieben.blogspot.de/2012/04/in-their-2010-paper-search-for-search.html">here</a> and <a href="http://dieben.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-erratum-for-dembskis-and-markss.html">here</a>) of whether Marks and Dembski
have actually proven their Horizontal No Free Lunch Theorem.  His
arguments are interesting and strike me as cogent.  But whether or not
that theorem is proven, the point remains that evolution will do badly almost
all the time on a white noise fitness function. So a smoother fitness
function is required.  But, as we have seen, the laws of physics
make a white noise fitness function unlikely.  This is true whether or not
the HNFL theorem can be proven rigorously.</p>

<p><strong>New types of information?  Important to arguing for Design?</strong></p>

<p>The point about physics and the unlikelihood of white noise fitness functions
is also true
however we define information, and it is true
whether natural selection “creates” information or whether it takes
existing information that is implicit in the smoothness of the fitness
surface and
repackages it in the genome.  I suspect that Dembski and Marks’s “active
information” will end up not being a helpful concept, but for the purposes of
my present critique that issue is not central.</p>

<p><strong>What Richard Dawkins’s “Weasel” model was not intended to do</strong></p>

<p>One should note in passing Dembski’s use of Richard Dawkins’s “Methinks It Is
a Weasel” model.  In his Chicago talk, Dembski portrays Dawkins as arguing that the Weasel model shows that
natural selection can originate information, and portrays Dawkins as
claiming that it is a
realistic model of evolution.  Dawkins was not arguing that it was a
realistic model of evolution, or that this evolution originated new
information.  Dawkins’s model was a teaching example to show why creationist
debaters who argue that natural selection is doing a “random” search are
disingenuous.  The Weasel search succeeds in about 1000 steps, while a
truly random search would take astronomical numbers of steps.  Dawkins’s model
is an effective teaching device.  It is routinely misrepresented in the
creationist and ID literature as intended to be a realistic model of
evolution, and intended to prove assertions about where the information in
life originates.  Unfortunately Dembski has followed this sad tradition.</p>

<p><strong>Is Dembski’s theology of information central to his argument about
evolution?</strong></p>

<p>No, because he’s got to end up arguing that, for the laws of phyics to be
the way they are, requires some active Design. But once the laws of physics
are admitted, how they got that way is just not part of any argument about evolution.
Biologists will certainly decide not to waste time on the issue and to leave it to cosmologists.</p>
