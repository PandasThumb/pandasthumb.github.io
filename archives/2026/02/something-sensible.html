<p>We’re used to seeing all sorts of silliness at the Discovery Institute’s website 
“Science &amp; Culture Today”  (formerly called Evolution News).  A staple of the 
site is an article describing how wonderfully well-adapted some feature of an organism is, with 
the implied conclusion that this could only have come from Design Intervention.</p>

<p>Recent posts there have continued their tradition of being even more 
astonishing than that.  Here are three examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An expert on German literature, Neil Thomas, wrote on <a href="https://scienceandculture.com/2026/01/the-monster-in-the-sky-revisiting-atheisms-creation-myth/">“The Monster in the Sky”: Revisiting Atheism’s Creation Myth</a>, in which he 
said:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>My hope in this endeavor is to throw additional light on the subject of Victorians’ reception of Darwin’s Origin of Species, asking specifically what factors might explain our ancestors’ acquiescence in accepting a theory bereft of empirical documentation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he really means that.  See my earlier discussion of his views <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/11/Darwinist-changes-his-mind.html"><strong>here</strong></a></p>

<ol>
  <li>Emily Reeves, trained in nutritional biochemistry, discovered a remarkable 
feature of evolutionary change.  In her post <a href="https://scienceandculture.com/2025/12/merry-christmas-no-8-story-for-2025-optimization-and-evolution-before-our-eyes/">Merry Christmas! No. 8 Story for 2025: Optimization and “Evolution Before Our Eyes”</a> 
she reported on studies on evolutionary tradeoffs in Darwin’s Finches, using the 
studies of Peter and Rosemary Grant and others.  She finds the fatal flaw!</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see that, in the most classic example of “evolution happening before our eyes,” genetic variation was present <em>before</em> the adaptive radiation. Whether this is truly “evolution” is, then, a question worth discussing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>And just to round off a trifecta, Granville Sewell shows up, for the n-th time, 
summarizing his surpassingly silly old argument that there is something-like-a-Second-Law 
preventing chaotic physical processes from leading to adaptations, human achievements, 
and technology.  This latest effusion will be found <a href="https://scienceandculture.com/2026/02/a-friend-asks-for-darwin-skeptics-what-does-the-second-law-argument-accomplish/"><strong>here</strong></a></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But occasionally there is a post that argues an 
important case for common sense.  On January 7 of 
this year, their house bioethicist Wesley J. Smith 
made this agonized plea:</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>In a post on January 7, Wesley Smith wrote an impassioned plea for 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. not to defund animal research, as he has announced he 
will do.  It will be found 
<a href="https://scienceandculture.com/2026/01/for-mahas-sake-dont-eliminate-animal-experimentation/"><strong>here</strong></a></p>

<p>The article makes a plea for common sense.
I am in agreement, and you should be too. Here is 
a major statement of his argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But scientists do not engage these methodologies out of sadistic purpose. Rather, their goals are to find new medical treatments, cure diseases, and generally reduce human (and animal) suffering. Indeed, without animal research, the many medical and veterinary advances achieved since World War II would have been impossible. That is why we must think about this important moral issue and not just “feel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is encouraging that common sense can occasionally 
prevail.</p>

<h3 id="and-why-does-animal-research-work">And why does animal research work?</h3>

<p>Wesley Smith does not go further into why animal 
research turns out to be useful.  Why should we expect that 
advances in understanding of human hearts might come from studying 
mammals, rather than, say, carrots?  <em>Because we’re 
much more closely related to mammals than to carrots</em>.
There is where medical research makes use of evolutionary 
biology every day, no matter how rarely medical 
researchers talk about it.</p>

<p>We can hope that Wesley Smith will ponder whether 
his friends at S&amp;C are helping our understanding of humans 
by rejecting evidence for evolution.</p>

<h3 id="conspiracies">Conspiracies</h3>

<p>And of course there are any more issues.  Vaccines, 
anyone?  There are rampant nonsensical conspiracy 
theories saying that messenger RNA in vaccines is 
intended to kill you, or at least change who you 
vote for.  Wesley Smith’s colleagues 
at S&amp;C have repeatedly described evolutionary 
biologists as deliberate liars whose basic motive is 
not to understand evolution, but to destroy 
religion.  That too is a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>The broader right-wing movement is saturated 
with conspiracy theories, from the delusion that 
there is a Great Replacement conspiracy to the fantasy 
that the 2020 election was stolen.  JFKJr is a 
crackpot’s crackpot who is busy appointing his 
crackpot friends to HHS, to NIH, and to CDC.</p>

<p>Wesley Smith has shown that he can see clearly what 
is going on, at least in one important case.  We 
look forward to more of his honest appraisals.</p>
