  <p>Carla Hinton, writing in <i>The Oklahoman</i>, <a href="http://newsok.com/uco-student-group-rescinds-invitation-to-christian-speaker-ken-ham/article/5582635">informs us</a>,</p>

<blockquote>The University of Central Oklahoma Student Association rescinded its invitation to a well-known Christian apologist to speak on campus following pressure from an LGBTQ group.<br /><br />

Wednesday, Stockton Duvall, UCO's student body president, said student government leaders, in partnership with a student group called Valid World Views, had asked Ken Ham to visit the campus on March 5 to share his perspectives about the science behind Darwinian ideas. ...<br /><br />

Duvall, a junior business management major, said members of a group affiliated with the Women's Research Center/BGLTQ+ Student Center at UCO opposed Ham's visit because of his view that marriage is between one man and one woman.</blockquote>

<p>Charles Johnson, the vice president of communications, said that the administration “may advise, but does not direct, the activities of [The University of Central Oklahoma Student Association].” He added, somewhat mysteriously,</p>

<blockquote>This experience reinforces our resolve to make our campus a welcoming environment for the civil expression of diverse thought.</blockquote>

<p>Ms. Hinton has provided a full statement by President Don Betz <a href="http://newsok.com/article/5582771"> here</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Ham will be allowed to speak at the Fairview Baptist Church in Edmond, Oklahoma, on March 5. He is obviously furious and <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/religious-freedom/university-denies-free-speech">attacks</a> what he calls a “hotbed of anti-Christian activity … in tax funded universities.” I would not go as far as to say that Mr. Ham’s disinvitation is necessarily anti-Christian activity (it had to do with his contemptible views on marriage equality), and I do not think that removing nativity scenes from the public square compares with allowing corporations to deny their employees health care based on religious objections, but I am afraid that Mr. Ham has a point. He should have been allowed to speak, and those who disagreed with him should be allowed to demonstrate against his unfavorable views or to ask pointed questions after his talk.</p>

<p>I have nothing but scorn for Mr. Ham’s views on science or religion, but I think we do ourselves no good by refusing to listen to views that we consider wrong or reprehensible. The University is supposed to be a place of free speech, of trading ideas. Listen to someone you disagree with, and you might learn something, or you might strengthen your arguments against that person. Though I might draw the line at someone spewing racist or even fascist excrescences, and I think that Mr. Ham is wrong about almost everything, I think that the invitation should not have been withdrawn.</p>
