  <p><em>A parallel thread to this one will be found at <a href="http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/eric-holloway-needs-our-help-new-post-at-pandas-thumb/">The Skeptical Zone</a>.</em></p>

<p>At <a href="https://mindmatters.today/"><strong>Mind
 Matters</strong></a>, the blog of the Discovery Institute’s Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence, <a href="https://mindmatters.today/2018/10/does-information-theory-support-design-in-nature/"><strong>Eric Holloway has argued</strong></a> that no critic of Intelligent Design has
yet refuted William Dembski’s information-theoretic arguments for ID.</p>

<p>The situation sounds dire. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
When I first began to look into intelligent design (ID) theory while I was considering becoming an
atheist, I was struck by Bill Dembski's claim that ID could be demonstrated mathematically
through information theory. A number of authors who were experts in computer science and
information theory disagreed with Dembski's argument. They offered two criticisms: that he did
not provide enough details to make the argument coherent and that he was making claims that were at
odds with established information theory.

In online discussions, I pressed a number of them, including Jeffrey Shallit, Tom English, Joe
Felsenstein, and Joshua Swamidass. I also read a number of their articles. But I have not been able
to discover a precise reason why they think Dembski is wrong. Ironically, they actually tend to
agree with Dembski when the topic lies within their respective realms of expertise. For example, in
his rebuttal Shallit considered an idea which is very similar to the ID concept of "algorithmic
specified complexity". The critics tended to pounce when addressing Dembski's claims
outside their realms of expertise.
</blockquote>

<p>Is that really the state of debate about Dembski’s arguments?  I’d say that we can point to
a number of arguments that Holloway must have missed.  Let me list them …</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>Here is a list of some arguments against William Dembski’s use of Complex Specified Information
to validate Intelligent Design:</p>

<ol>
<li> Dembski's original CSI argument used a Law of Conservation of Complex Specified Information (LCCSI) to
establish that a population had to be in a state which already had CSI in order to subsequently
be in a state which had CSI.  In his 2002 book
<em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without
Intelligence</em>, chapter 4 was entitled "Life's Conservation Law"
and discussed the LCCSI.
Dembski said of this chapter 
that "this chapter
is the climax of the book".  However ...
<ul>
<li>  Wesley Elsberry and Jeffrey Shallit, in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-009-9542-8.pdf"><strong>2011 paper</strong></a> in the philosophical journal <em>Synthese</em>,
noted that Dembski's sketched proof of his LCCSI required that the specification be independent of any
mechanisms of change.  They pointed out that the actual before-and-after specifications that Dembski used in
his LCCSI proof violated this.
Holloway, in his Mind Matters post, also states that the specification needs to be independent
of any mechanisms of change, but does not explain why Elsberry and Shallit's
 argument is not then decisive.</li>
<li> Erik Tellgren <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/dembski_LCI.pdf"><strong>carefully examined Dembski's argument</strong></a> and concluded that Dembski had not
proven that the specification that he gave for the generation preceding
the current generation satisfied the requirement that it be independent of
 the evolutionary processes involved.</li>
<li>  In <a href="ncse.com/rncse/27/3-4/has-natural-selection-been-refuted-arguments-william-dembski"><strong>my 2007
 paper</strong></a> on Dembski's arguments, I pointed out that the proof of the LCCSI changes the
specification in each generation.  But Dembski's objective is to prove that natural selection and other evolutionary
processes cannot make the population have high fitness if it originally doesn't, <em>so we need
to keep the specification the same before and after</em>.  Dembski's ever-changing specification
 thus fails to show that a population cannot move into a state of higher fitness.</li>
 </ul></li>
<li> Starting in 2005, Dembski changed the definition of his CSI.  He'd say that he
clarified it, showing what he had meant all along.  But after 2005, his original LCCSI is no
longer discussed.  Instead he has a new way of proving that CSI cannot be achieved by natural
evolutionary forces: <em>he simply refuses to define the population as having CSI if its state
can be achieved by natural evolutionary forces!</em>  It's only CSI if evolution can't get there.  So
how do we know that?  He doesn't say -- it's up to us to find a way to show that, in order to
be able to call it CSI.   Which reverses the whole effect of showing something has CSI.
CSI formerly was being used to show evolution couldn't get there.  Now we have to separately
show (somehow) that evolution can't get there before we can call it CSI.  Which makes CSI a useless add-on to the whole
argument.  Dembski's new argument will be found <a href="https://billdembski.com/documents/2005.06.Specification.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.  It was published in
<em>Philosophia Christi</em> in 2005.  Some further comments on the new argument by me will be
 found <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/04/does-csi-enable.html"><strong>here</strong></a> (comments
 are missing as in many older PT threads -- we hope to restore them some day soon).</li>
<li> Then in 2009, William Dembski and Robert Marks rolled out <a href="https://evoinfo.org/papers/2009_ConservationOfInformationInSearch.pdf"><strong>a new argument</strong></a> -- that when
natural selection could succeed in increasing fitness, this was only because of the pattern of
fitnesses of genotypes.  They defined "active information" that came from that pattern of
fitnesses.  They argued that this information must have been "front-loaded" into the situation
by nature.  Problem is, this wasn't an argument about how natural evolutionary forces could
not increase fitness.  Instead it argued that when they could do the job, it was only
because a Design Intervention enabled that.  Some rebuttal of their argument by Tom English 
and I will be found <a href="http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/at-pandas-thumb-an-evaluation-of-dembski-ewert-and-markss-search-for-a-search-argument/"><strong>here</strong></a>
 (at The Skeptical Zone).</li>
</ol>
<p>So only Dembski’s first argument, the one using the Law of Conservation of
Complex Specified Information, even tried to show that there was some
information-based Law that prevented natural selection from putting
adaptive information into the genome.  And, as we’ve seen, that law does not work to do
that.  And Holloway seems to have missed that.  As he missed all these 
other refutations of Dembski.</p>

<h2>Deja vu</h2>

<p>Holloway has had such difficulties before.  In August 2011, on the
creationist/ID blog Uncommon Descent, <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/critics-agree-with-dembski-the-no-free-lunch-theorem-applies-to-evolution/"><strong>Holloway
argued</strong></a> that even William Dembski’s critics all acknowledged
that his No Free Lunch argument was valid.  He wrote that
each critic acknowledged that Dembski’s application of the No
Free Lunch Theorem was valid, but all of the critics claimed that
there was a problem somewhere else – outside of the critic’s domain
of expertise.</p>

<p>Dembski’s No Free Lunch argument, put forward
in his 2002 book, was not framed in terms of information theory.  And it came
under immediate, and devastating, attack by many critics, all of whom
concurred that the argument failed to show that the 1997 <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf"><strong>No Free Lunch
 Theorem of Wolpert and Macready</strong></a> posed any problem for evolutionary biology.</p>

<p>Those devastating responses were:</p>

<li> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11229-009-9542-8.pdf"><strong>By Wesley Elsberry and Jeffrey Shallit</strong></a> in <em>Synthese</em> in 2011, and also <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/eandsdembski.pdf"><strong>a version published in 2004</strong></a> at the website talkreason.org.</li>

 <em>Biology and Philosophy</em> in 2007</strong></a>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I have also given what I claim to be the clearest explanation of these objections, in
my <a href="http://ncse.com/rncse/27/3-4/has-natural-selection-been-refuted-arguments-william-dembski"><strong>2007
article in the <em>Reports of the National Center for Science Education</em></strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Attention called to these criticims</h2>

<p>In 2011, after these criticisms of Dembski’s No Free Lunch argument had been
available for years, <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/critics-agree-with-dembski-the-no-free-lunch-theorem-applies-to-evolution/"><strong>Eric Holloway argued</strong></a> at Uncommon Descent that critics of Dembski
had admitted that the No Free Lunch argument applied to biological
evolution.  Summarizing the state of the debate in a comment in that thread
<a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/critics-agree-with-dembski-the-no-free-lunch-theorem-applies-to-evolution/#comment-397213"><strong>Holloway said:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
So, I spent some time reading the critics, and this bore my frustration. I
could not find one author who treated Dembski's work fairly! If someone
could fairly refute Dembski's work I'd be all over it, but I
haven't found anyone! Instead it's all passive aggressive ad homineum
and brow beating, with ample burning of strawmen, very tiring to read.
</blockquote>

<p>Astonished by this wildly wrong summary of the situation, I posted <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/criticisms-of-d.html"><strong>at Panda’s Thumb</strong></a> arguing that Holloway had missed numerous cogent
refutations of Dembski’s use of the No Free Lunch Theorem.</p>

<p>On August 28, 2011 Holloway <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/follow-up-to-critics-agreeing-with-dembski-re-nfl/"><strong>responded at Uncommon Descent</strong></a> – I thought
extraordinarily weakly.  He simply said that empirical evidence
was that most mutations were deleterious, an observation that hardly
grapples with the criticisms of Dembski’s use of the No Free Lunch
Theorem.</p>

<h2>... all over again</h2>

<p>So here we are again, and once again Holloway is not seeing any
valid criticisms of Dembski’s argument, and is saying that the
criticisms of Dembski’s Conservation Law argument aren’t valid.  It is
as if the critics and their arguments didn’t exist.</p>

<p>Can we get Holloway to take a look at whether Dembski’s information-theory-based
arguments are still standing, unrefuted?  As you can see, it’s been hard to get him to
acknowledge such things before.  It’s deja vu, and all over again.</p>
