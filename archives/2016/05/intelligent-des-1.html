  <p>An article in The Star Press datelined Muncie, Indiana, today proclaimed, <a href="http://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2016/05/10/intelligent-design-prof-earns-tenure/83916274/">‘Intelligent design’ professor earns tenure at Ball State</a>. The professor in question is Eric Hedin, a physics professor who, as we <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/08/president-of-ba.html">reported in 2013</a>, is apparently an intelligent-design creationist and once taught a course called <a href="http://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/education/2014/05/08/ball-state-promotes-professor-course-dispute/8878971/">Boundaries of Science</a>. The class has, however, been canceled, and Professor Hedin has presumably been enjoined to not teach creationism in his physics classes. (No, my very dear trolls, that is not a violation of his freedom of speech.)</p>

<p>I looked up <a href="http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/physicsandastronomy/facultyandstaffdirectory/hedineric">Professor Hedin</a> and find that his research interests include “Teleology.” He has what seems to me a heavy teaching load, primarily General Physics 1 and 2, 5 mornings a week. I followed a link to his publications and find that he has a steady stream of publications in what look like respectable journals and conference proceedings. I did not see any papers that looked like they were concerned with teleology, and I presume that he is not surreptitiously teaching creationism.</p>

<p>The physics department at Ball State is blessed with 2 intelligent-design creationists. Panda’s Thumb reported, about 1 month before our report on Professor Hedin, that <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/07/gonzalez-appoin.html">Gonzalez [is] appointed assistant professor at Ball State University</a>, referring to the intelligent-design creationist Guillermo Gonzalez. Professor Gonzalez had famously been denied tenure at Iowa State University, presumably for failure to conduct an original research program and instead writing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Privileged-Planet-Cosmos-Designed-Discovery-ebook/dp/B004SBDA54">The Privileged Planet</a>: How Our Place in the Cosmos Is Designed for Discovery.</p>

<p>A morbid curiosity getting the better of me, I looked up Professor Gonzalez in Google Scholar and also <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=1362">here</a>. I do not know when he became a fellow of the Discovery Institute, but I noted no publications of interest after 2007, though he was a co-author of a book on observational astronomy in 2006. Like almost every other fellow of the DI, Professor Gonzalez appears to have produced virtually nothing since joining that institute.</p>

<p>But let us end on a positive note: The same cannot be said for Eric Hedin, and I must assume that his promotion and tenure are well deserved.</p>
