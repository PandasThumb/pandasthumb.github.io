  <img src="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2016/04/wafflehouse-150x113.jpg" alt="wafflehouse" width="150" height="113" style="float: right" /><p class='lead'>Solemn greetings, all. Today, as the more reverent among you know, is <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2015/04/07/happy-paul-nelson-day/">Paul Nelson Day</a>. Today is the 12th annual feast day of St Nelson, patron saint of obtusity and procrastination, and we honor his contributions to <q>science</q> by...well, by not doing much of anything at all. You could make grandiose claims today and promise to make good on them tomorrow, a tomorrow that stretches out into a decade or more, I suppose, but that's too much work. Instead, maybe we should all just shrug and say we'll think about celebrating later.</p>

<p>Oh, jeez, <em>shrugging</em>? I don't have time for that. How about if we don't and just say we did.</p>

<p>I also thought about suggesting waffles as the perfect food for this day, but nah, I'd have to cook them, or go to a restaurant. I'm just going to say "waffles!" and put it off to some other day.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you don't know the story, Paul Nelson is a creationist who attended the Society for Developmental Biology meetings in 2004, with a poster in which he claimed to have developed this new evo-devoish parameter, Ontogenetic Depth,  that supposedly measured the difficulty of developmental complexity to evolve. I quizzed him on it, and specifically asked him to explain how I could measure it in my zebrafish, for example, and he couldn't tell me, even though he seemed to be saying that he and a student had been doing these 'measurements'. But he promised to send me a paper he was working on that explained it all. Tomorrow! A tomorrow that never came.</p>

<p>So now we remind him of his failure every year. It's a good thing to point out to Intelligent Design creationists that they don't seem to be very good at fulfilling their grand promises.</p>

<p>He seems to sometimes notice that he's being mocked, at least. Last year, he tried to trot out <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2015/04/07/paul-nelson-day-will-be-back-next-year/">Ontogenetic Depth 2.0</a>, which was just as impractical and ill-conceived as the first non-existent version. Maybe he'll have a new beta for us this year, too?</p>

<p>Unlikely. Too much work. Not in the spirit of the day.</p>
