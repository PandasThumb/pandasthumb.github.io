<p>I was dismayed last Thursday to see <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/science/conservatives-have-difficult-relationship-science/">the following paragraph</a> posted by AiG under Ken Ham’s byline:</p>
<blockquote>In the <a href="https://theconversation.com/many-conservatives-have-a-difficult-relationship-with-science-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-165499">article</a> [in <i>The Conversation</i>], the author uses the term <i>science</i> to refer to the so-called “scientific consensus” regarding things such as climate change alarmism, vaccinations, evolution, and a lack of “human exceptionalism.” But what the author is failing to recognize is the difference between observational and historical science. In other words, this author has a “difficult relationship with science” because the author doesn’t understand the word <i>science</i>.</blockquote>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>For some time, Answers in Genesis has <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/environmental-science/ice-cores-secret-understanding-earths-climate/">minimized the importance of human-made climate change</a>, as have <a href="https://creation.com/climate-change">Creation Ministries International</a> and the <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2020/04/tyson-and-cosmos-sound-the-climate-alarm-again/">Discovery Institute</a>, and this position of necessity involves denying the authority of a declared scientific consensus. However, Answers in Genesis has hitherto accepted the value of vaccines, and in two recent related articles, <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/human-body/wise-blood-overcoming-in-disease-immunity-part-1/">here</a> and <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/human-body/wise-blood-antibodies-principle-overcoming-disease-part-2/">here</a>, gives a detailed scientific account of how vaccines work, and praises their effectiveness in the context of the complexity of the immune system, which of course for AiG is evidence for creation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://theconversation.com/many-conservatives-have-a-difficult-relationship-with-science-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-165499">article in <i>The Conversation</i></a>, cited above, reports that “[p]eople with a libertarian or conservative worldview are more likely to reject climate change and evolution and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123">are less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19</a>,” and in the US context relates such rejection of science and an exaggerated view of human exceptionalism, to religiosity.</p>

<p>The historical versus observation nonsense is familiar, as are the attacks on scientific consensus and on concern about climate change, and our models of climate change do indeed involve the “historical science” that uses ice cores and other techniques to map climate change throughout the Ice Ages and beyond. But including “vaccinations” in the areas of scientific consensus apparently to be rejected is alarming. The study of vaccine effectiveness is very much part of current observational science, and we can see no good reason for Answers in Genesis to be turning against it, even on their own terms.
What we must fear is that AiG may be about to fall in line with other creationist institutions ranging from <a href="https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B200723">Grace Community Church</a> to the <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2020/08/in-fauci-we-trust-c-s-lewis-foresaw-scientific-authoritarianism/">Discovery Institute</a> in minimizing the severity of an epidemic that is known to have killed 644,840 people in the US and 4,442,332 worldwide (<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">as of August 22</a>). AiG was from the outset <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/coronavirus/coronavirus-biblical-practical/">ambivalent about masks</a>, and even jokingly (or blasphemously) telling its readers <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2020/11/28/therefore-tell-you-do-not-be-anxious-about-covid/">not to be anxious about COVID</a> just as Jesus told his disciples (Matthew 6:25-34) not to worry about the necessities of life. Despite a rash of articles in March and April of last year, arguing that the mutations giving rise to COVID were not really examples of evolution, AiG has published nothing of significance on the subject since that time.</p>

<p>This does not bode well.</p>
