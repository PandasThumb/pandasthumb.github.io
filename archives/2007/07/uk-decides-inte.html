  <p>The UK government has followed in the footsteps of the Dover ruling by confirming that “intelligent design”, aka “neo-creationism” will not be taught in schools as part of the National Curriculum, reports <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2192888/government-decides-intelligent">VNU Net</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science National Curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently the Council or Europe <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe_report_challenges_teaching_of_Creationism">released a report addressing their concerns with “Intelligent Design”</a>.</p>

<p>The Register is even more direct by declaring that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/25/id_not_science/">“UK Gov boots intelligent design back into ‘religious’ margins”</a></p>

<p>The government response comes in response to a <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12021.asp">petition</a> asking</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We received a petition asking:</p>

  <p>“We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to prevent the use of creationist and other pseudo-scientific propaganda in Government-funded schools.”</p>

  <p>Details of Petition:</p>

  <p>“The Prime Minister has recently spoken about the importance of science education in the UK. Creationism &amp; Intelligent design are greatly featured in the media and are being used disingenuously to portray science &amp; the theory or evolution as being in crisis when they are not. Moreover groups such as Truth in Science are targeting our nation’s children and their science education with material that is not only non-scientific but have been rejected by the scientific community. These ideas therefore do not constitute science, cannot be considered scientific education and therefore do not belong in the nation’s science classrooms.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Government remains committed ensuring that young people have an understanding of the importance of science and the world around them.</p>

  <p>Science is a core subject of the National Curriculum throughout every Key Stage. The National Curriculum secures for all pupils, irrespective of background and ability, an entitlement to a range of areas of learning. Its aim is to develop the knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes necessary for each pupil’s self-fulfilment and development as an active and responsible citizen. It makes expectations for learning and attainment explicit to pupils, parents, teachers, governors, employers and the public, and establishes national standards for the performance of all pupils. All materials that support the teaching, learning and assessment of primary and secondary education, can be found on the National Curriculum website (new window).</p>

  <p>The Government is aware that a number of concerns have been raised in the media and elsewhere as to whether creationism and intelligent design have a place in science lessons. The Government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science National Curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science. The science programmes of study set out the legal requirements of the science National Curriculum. They focus on the nature of science as a subject discipline, including what constitutes scientific evidence and how this is established. Students learn about scientific theories as established bodies of scientific knowledge with extensive supporting evidence, and how evidence can form the basis for experimentation to test hypotheses. In this context, the Government would expect teachers to answer pupils’ questions about creationism, intelligent design, and other religious beliefs within this scientific framework.</p>

  <p>We will be publishing guidance for schools, on the way creationism and intelligent design relate to science teaching. It will be possible to ensure that the weight of scientific opinion is properly presented. The guidance will be available on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority website in due course.</p>
