  <p><strong>By Brandon Haught, Communications Director of <a href="http://www.flascience.org/index.html">Florida Citizens for Science.</a></strong></p>

<p>Before I begin, let me give a brief recap of what’s going on for anyone just
joining us. Florida’s state science standards for public schools is
currently going through a revision process. The current standards are a
miserable mess, having been given a <a href="http://www.edexcellence.net/institute/publication/publication.cfm?id=352&amp;amp;pubsubid=1137#1137">grade
of F by the Fordham Institute</a>.
The standards don’t mention the word evolution, instead referring to
this important biology concept as simply “changes over time.” The draft
of the new standards feature evolution as one of the major concepts
students must know. The draft standards are now going through a public
review period. Anyone can go to the <a href="http://tools.fcit.usf.edu/ScienceReview/">website and
rate/comment</a> on the standards. Of course, the inclusion of evolution is causing
quite a stir. Several newspaper articles, editorials, letters to the
editors, online forum posts, etc. have been keeping track of this. The
public comment period closes about mid-December. Then the writing
committee will make any needed revisions to the draft. Finally, the
state board of education will vote on whether to accept the new
standards.</p>

<p>That is just the short version of what’s going on. For more details,
feel free to browse through <a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/">this blog’s </a> posts over the past few weeks. Of special note is the concern over the Polk County board of education
expressing displeasure over evolution in the standards.</p>

<p>Got all that? Now comes the next steep hill in this fun roller
coaster ride.  <a href="http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/8144.article">The Florida
Baptist Witness</a> has online an editorial by James Smith Sr. In this editorial he
complains about evolution being “dogmatic” and believes that there is a
real controversy within the scientific community over evolution. He
cites the Dissent from Darwin list as supposed proof. (<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3541_project_steve_2_16_2003.asp">Project
Steve</a> is an appropriate counter to that dishonest Dissent list.) Smith
doesn’t mind using the Discovery Institute, the public relations
machine for the anti-evolution crowd, as his crutch throughout this
article. So far there is nothing new or shocking coming from Smith.
Unfortunately, his readership might be influenced by his drivel, but
that’s his job after all.</p>

<p>But then he reports that he had an e-mail conversation with Florida
Board of Education member <a href="http://www.fldoe.org/board/bios/Callaway.asp">Donna Callaway</a>.
Callaway states quite clearly that she is going to vote against the new
standards because of evolution. She’s apparently not advocating
actually teaching intelligent design, the Discovery Institute’s
creationist Trojan horse. But she does think that students need to be
exposed to “other theories” in some way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I agree completely that evolution should be taught with
all of the research and study that has occurred. However, I believe it
should not be taught to the exclusion of other theories of origin of
life,” Callaway told me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Smith and Callaway don’t understand is that those other
theories of origin of life are not science. There is not even a thimble
full of scientific evidence in intelligent design. Cold, hard facts
have exposed <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/">in a court of
law</a> that intelligent design is nothing more than a vehicle for inserting
religion into the public school science classroom. Even as a footnote,
allowing intelligent design into biology lessons forces children to
make a choice. Students are smart. As soon as intelligent design
mentions its unspecified “intelligent designer,” kids know that the
conversation is about God. That then sends a signal to students that
religion is in conflict with science and that they have to pick one or
the other. That’s a potential showstopper, turning many students off of
science because they are falsely led to believe that the issue is God
versus no God. That does a disservice to both religion and science.
There are <a href="http://www.clergyletterproject.net/index.php">many
religions</a> that have no problem at all with accepting evolution.</p>

<p>The common refrain to the steadfast resistance to having intelligent
design in the classroom is that evolution is a theory in crisis and
can’t stand up to criticism. Yes it can stand up to criticism. It has
for about 150 years! Every single scientific theory by its very nature
is falsifiable. If it’s not falsifiable, it’s not science. If the
intelligent design crowd has the evidence to bring evolution down, then
they need to provide the scientific evidence. They won’t do it, though.
All of their time is spent on public relations.</p>

<p>Smith and Callaway have a dangerous mindset. It’s obvious they have
little understanding of what science is, or they are willfully being
deceitful. This is dangerous because Smith has an audience to preach to
and Callaway has a vote on the state Board of Education. They can rob
students of a proper science education; an education sorely needed in
this state. Everyone in this country has a right to freely practice
religion, but every student in our public schools also has a right to a
good science education that will prepare them for their adult lives in
this rapidly changing world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although she is not attempting to “arouse controversy,”
Callaway told me she is concerned about what’s best for children. “I
want an informed public so that when these and other similar decisions
are made that affect all of us that they are reflective of how the
people feel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science is not about how people feel, Ms. Callaway. It’s about a
methodical way of exploring and understanding the natural world around
us. Science is about discovering a body of facts, piecing those facts
together to hopefully reveal a fuller understanding of what is being
studied, and then presenting that work to the scientific community.
That community will then pick apart the work, test it, test it again,
and test it some more. There is no popularity vote. The work has to
stand on its own merits. The “informed public” is best served by
learning science in the science classroom. Evolution is science.
Intelligent design is not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A longtime, active member of First Baptist Church
in Tallahassee, Callaway added, “My hope is that there will be times of
prayer throughout Christian homes and churches directed toward this
issue. As a SBOE member, I want those prayers. I want God to be part of
this. Isn’t that ironic?”</p>

  <p>Not at all, as far as I’m concerned. Indeed,
Florida Baptists should pray for the State Board of Education — as well
as let their opinions be heard on this vital matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be careful what you wish for, Ms. Callaway and Mr. Smith.</p>
