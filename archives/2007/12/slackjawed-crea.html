  <p class="lead">I am so amused. A <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/12/07/biologist_fired_for_beliefs_suit_says/?p1=MEWell_Pos2">creationist lost his job at Woods Hole</a>, and he was a <i>zebrafish developmental biologist</i>. Hey, I know a little bit about that!</p>

<p>The creationist, Nathaniel Abraham, briefly held a post-doctoral position under Mark Hahn at Woods Hole. Here's the creationist's side:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nathaniel Abraham filed a lawsuit earlier this week in US District Court in Boston saying that the Cape Cod research center dismissed him in 2004 because of his Christian belief that the Bible presents a true account of human creation.</p>

<p>Abraham, who is seeking $500,000 in compensation for a violation of his civil rights, says in the suit that he lost his job as a postdoctoral researcher in a biology lab shortly after he told his superior that he did not accept evolution as scientific fact.</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the scientist's side:</p>

<blockquote><p>But on Nov. 17, Hahn asked him to resign, pointing out in the letter that Abraham should have known of evolution's centrality to the project because it was evident from the job advertisement and grant proposal.</p>

<p>". . . You have indicated that you do not recognize the concept of biological evolution and you would not agree to include a full discussion of the evolutionary implications and interpretations of our research in any co-authored publications resulting from this work," Hahn wrote in the letter, which the commission provided to the Globe. "This position is incompatible with the work as proposed to NIH and with my own vision of how it should be carried out and interpreted."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The commission [the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination] dismissed his complaint earlier this year. The commission said Abraham was terminated because his request not to work on evolutionary aspects of the project would be challenging for Woods Hole because the research was based on evolutionary theories.</p></blockquote>
