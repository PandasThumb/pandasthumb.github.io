  <p><strong>Oops, someone pointed out to me that this publication preceded the DI’s press tour.</strong></p>

<p>Poor Discovery Institute, after spending much time and effort on trying, unsuccessfully, to generate some media interest on the Gonzalez tenure case, all they got was a cynical response from <a href="http://www.macjohnson.com/">Mac Johnson</a> at the conservative site <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=23404">Human Events.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So in light of the issue’s new prominence and with a desire to improve the mental hygiene of others, I would just like to say that Intelligent Design is a really, really bad idea –scientifically, politically, and theologically.  I say this as a dedicated conservative, who has on many occasions defended and espoused religion and religious conservatism.  I also say it as a professional molecular biologist, who has worked daily (or at least week-daily) for years with biological problems to which the theory of evolution has contributed significant understanding – and to which Intelligent Design is incapable of contributing any understanding at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far Mac Johnson has remained silent on the topic, largely because he shares some common beliefs with many of ID’s supporters but he cannot longer remain silent</p>

<p>On the scientific front, ID has little to contribute</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientifically, attributing every aspect of biology to the arbitrary design of a divine tinkerer explains as much about biology as attributing the eruption of volcanoes to the anger of the Lava God would explain geology.  A theory, by definition, makes predictions that can be tested.  Intelligent Design predicts nothing, since it essentially states that every thing is the way it is because God wanted it that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only does ID fail scientifically to be a relevant paradigm, it also is offensive to many because of the theological impact of its arguments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And as a matter of religion, ID is offensive to me in the lack of faith it demonstrates on the part of its proponents.  I believe in God.  My belief in Him is not dependent upon his being the motive force in developing shorter dandelion varieties for lawns and longer varieties for roadsides.  I am not sure what God is.  I am not sure what His role in this world is.  But I am sure He is.  I don’t need to have that belief enshrined in “theory” and validated by the approval of a county school board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems that even those who should be the Discovery Institute’s closest allies are distancing themselves from the scientifically vacuous and theologically risky concept of ‘Intelligent Design’.</p>

<p>I cannot blame them</p>
