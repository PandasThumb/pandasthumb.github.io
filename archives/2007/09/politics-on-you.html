  <p>The <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003877213_brain10.html">Seattle Times</a> has an interesting article on the link between political views and the brain</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a study likely to raise the hackles of some conservatives, scientists at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a specific region of the brain’s cortex is more sensitive in people who consider themselves liberals than in self-declared conservatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the findings we can make some predictions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the results, Sulloway said, liberals could be expected to more readily accept new social, scientific or religious ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or alternatively, conservatives will be less ready to accept new scientific ideas.</p>

<p>Imagine <a href="http://www.discovery.org/blogs/discoveryblog/2007/09/political_science_meet_politic.php">that</a></p>

<p>Well now we understand</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analyzing the data, Sulloway said liberals were 4.9 times more likely than conservatives to show activity in the brain circuits that deal with conflicts and were 2.2 times more likely to score in the top half of the distribution for accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study follows an earlier study based on a meta-analysis of various data sources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most comprehensive review of personality and political orientation to date is a 2003 meta-analysis of 88 prior studies involving 22,000 participants. The researchers—John Jost of NYU, Arie Kruglanski of the University of Maryland, and Jack Glaser and Frank Sulloway of Berkeley—found that conservatives have a greater desire to reach a decision quickly and stick to it, and are higher on conscientiousness, which includes neatness, orderliness, duty, and rule-following. Liberals are higher on openness, which includes intellectual curiosity, excitement-seeking, novelty, creativity for its own sake, and a craving for stimulation like travel, color, art, music, and literature.</p>

  <p>The study’s authors also concluded that conservatives have less tolerance for ambiguity, a trait they say is exemplified when George Bush says things like, “Look, my job isn’t to try to nuance. My job is to tell people what I think,” and “I’m the decider.” Those who think the world is highly dangerous and those with the greatest fear of death are the most likely to be conservative.</p>

  <p>Liberals, on the other hand, are “more likely to see gray areas and reconcile seemingly conflicting information,” says Jost. As a result, liberals like John Kerry, who see many sides to every issue, are portrayed as flip-floppers. “Whatever the cause, Bush and Kerry exemplify the cognitive styles we see in the research,” says Jack Glaser, one of the study’s authors, “Bush in appearing more rigid in his thinking and intolerant of uncertainty and ambiguity, and Kerry in appearing more open to ambiguity and to considering alternative positions.”</p>

<p>The research paper can be found <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn1979.html">Online</a> although it may take a liberal to actually locate it :-)</p>
