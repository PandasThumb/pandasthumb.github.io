  <p>A news story today from Oregon (story <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/4645374.html">here</a>) is headlined “Oregon teacher fired after veering from evolution textbook.”</p>

<p>The story says, in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his eight days as a part-time biology teacher at Sisters High School, Kris Helphinstine included Biblical references in material he provided to students and gave a PowerPoint presentation that made links between evolution, Nazi Germany and Planned Parenthood.</p>

  <p>That was enough for the Sisters School Board, which fired the teacher Monday night for deviating from the curriculum on the theory of evolution. …</p>

  <p>Helphinstine, 27, said in a phone interview with The Bulletin newspaper of Bend that he included the supplemental material **to teach students about bias in sources, and his only agenda was to teach critical thinking.</p>

  <p>“Critical thinking is vital to scientific inquiry,” said Helphinstine, who has a master’s degree in science from Oregon State. “My whole purpose was to give accurate information and to get them thinking.”**</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well good for him - his plan worked: the students, parents and school Board clearly saw his bias, and they used their critical thinking skills to conclude that his teaching was completely inappropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think his performance was not just a little bit over the line,” board member Jeff Smith said. “It was a severe contradiction of what we trust teachers to do in our classrooms.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the kind of critical thinking we need more of: thinking which sees the “critical thinking” ploy of the creationists as the dishonest ruse that it is.  Science is based on critical thinking, and it is a travesty that the creationists have co-opted this term to support their radical skepticism about the findings of mainstream science.</p>
