  <p>Last summer, I had it out with Uncommon Descent’s Salvador Cordova on the topic of Genetic Algorithms (GA’s).  During this series of posts, I explained that Dawkin’s use of a Targeted genetic algorithm - one that looks for the specific phrase “Methinks it is like a weasel” in simulations of selection and reproduction - was intended as a tutorial example only, and does <strong>not</strong>(as Dawkins himself pointed out way back in 1986) provide a rigorous simulation of evolution.  Since then, creationists of all stripes have tried time and again to smear <strong>all</strong>Genetic Algorithms with the “They Need a Specified Target - just like Dawkins’ Weasel” argument.</p>

<p>During the series of posts, which began <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/target-target-w-1.html">here</a>, and ended <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/genetic-algorit.html">here </a>(the latter having links to the summer’s salvos from both sides), Cordova said I was just sneaking in the answer to difficult math questions (involving Steiner Trees, an NP-hard math problem) instead of having the genetic algorithm “evolve” them properly.  Cordova presented an algorithm he claimed could do math problems without specifying an answer, just like mine, but I proved that his algorithm did indeed inevitably converge to an exact, specified result, quite unlike my GA for Steiner.</p>

<p>I posed an open, unsolved Steiner problem for the <a href="/archives/2006/08/take-the-design.html">Design Challenge</a>.  Dozens of math buffs responded, with <a href="/archives/2006/08/design-challeng-1.html">about half of them finding the exact answer to the problem, and the other half deriving viable (but less-than-optimal) solutions</a>.</p>

<p>Even with a week’s time, and the libraries and websites of the whole world available to him, Cordova failed to derive as good an answer to the given challenge as my evolution-based GA did in just a couple of hours.</p>

<p>About this time, Cordova stopped railing about Dawkins, Weasels, Selection, and Targets, and started saying that computers are just plain faster than humans at solving math problems.</p>

<p>While Cordova’s attack on GA’s in defense of ID was feeble at best, at least he was trying to keep up with parts of the discussion.</p>

<p>Not so Uncommon Descent contributor Patrick, who recently posted a little gem titled <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/ga-this/">“GA This!”</a></p>

<p>Rather than focusing on how new information might emerge from evolutionary processes, Patrick steps into the Wayback machine, demanding that GA’s produce not just a specified phrase a la “Weasel,” but instead a complete (and completely insipid) anti-evolutionary “poem.”</p>

<p>I kid you not.  I wonder if Dembski even knows what his silly monkeys are doing on his blog.  I guess ID theorists are never critical to each other, for the same reason you rarely hear harsh words exchanged publicly between members of the same church.</p>
