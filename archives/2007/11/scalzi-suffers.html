  <p class="lead">Last June, we <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/06/scalzi_has_to_go_to_the_creati.php">goaded</a> science-fiction author, blogger, and professional wise-ass <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/">John Scalzi</a> into promising to visit Ken Ham's Creation "Museum" (actually we bought his attendance by sending him money, which he turned around and <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/005203.html">donated</a> to <a href="http://www.au.org/">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>). </p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=121">Scalzi finally makes good on his promise</a>. It was worth it. There's both an <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=121">essay</a> and a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scalzi/sets/72157603091357751/">photo tour</a>. He was <i>amused</i> by it all.</p>

<blockquote><p>Indeed, it’s over the top enough that I never could actually get angry with the place. Not that I was planning to; I admit to dreading coming to the place, but that’s primarily because I thought it would bore and annoy me, not make me angry. In fact, I was never bored, and was genuinely annoyed only by the “paleontologist” at the start of the walk-through. The rest of the time I enjoyed it as I suspect anyone who is not some stripe of creationist could enjoy it: As camp. At some point — specifically the part where the Scopes Monkey Trial was presented as the end of decent Christian civilization as we know it — I just started chuckling my way through. By the time I got to the Dinosaur Den, with its placards full of patent misinformation about how soft tissue fossilization strongly suggested a massive, worldwide flood, I was a little loopy. It was just so ridiculous.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's some understanding for why the silly place is popular (apparently, attendance is quite good), and a recognition that it's all one big, ridiculous joke.</p>
