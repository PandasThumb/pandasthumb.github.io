  <p>This is an essay I wrote a few years ago when Jonathan Wells published the execrable <i>Icons of Evolution</i>. It was to be published in a book that never came to fruition, so I put it on my website. It is appropriate for <i>The Panda’s Thumb</i>, I think. Read it, and weep, seriously…</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<div class="Section1"> 
  <p>Let's suppose that you are of the belief that no artificial 
    thing can fly. Perhaps you are a member of the Omnian religion, and the sacred 
    <i>Book of Om</i> states 'nothing not made by 
    Om can fly through the air'. What can you do in a society that regularly 
    sends aircraft from one side of the planet to the other? How can you deal 
    with the evidence?</p>
  <p>Well, there are a few things you might do. First, you might 
    deny that things made by humans <i>do</i> fly. You might say they are in fact borne up by Om's invisible 
    minions. You might pick holes in the gaps of knowledge in modern aerodynamics, 
    and argue that because turbulent flows cannot be predicted, aerodynamics is 
    not a science. Or, you might look at aerodynamics textbooks.</p>
  <p>Any secondary school physics text or pilot licence manual 
    will tell you that aerofoils generate lift because of the Venturi effect. 
    Because a wing is curved at the top and not at the bottom, air flows faster 
    at the top than the bottom, so the pressure of air below the wing is greater 
    than the pressure above it. This means that the wing is pushed up from below, 
    and so generates lift. Textbooks are usually <a href="http://www.amasci.com/wing/airfoil.html">illustrated with simple flow 
    diagrams or wind tunnel photographs showing the way air is compressed above 
    the wing section.</a> Let us call this 'the best evidence of the Venturi 
    hypothesis'.</p>
  <p>But in the technical literature, you will find that this 
    is not the real or only explanation of lift. <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public2/lift.html">Air is also forced downwards</a>, 
    and on Newton's second law that every action causes an equal and opposite 
    reaction, this causes the wing to move in the opposite direction - up. Moreover, 
    flat sheets at the right angle of attack can generate lift in this way, and 
    so can inverted wing sections, as the audience at an air show can attest on 
    seeing aircraft fly upside down.</p>
  <p>Clearly, the textbooks are at odds with the science. Clearly, 
    the science is at odds with itself. Clearly, the 'theory of flight' 
    is a myth, founded on a series of false icons (nice touch, that - 'icon' 
    suggests, without needing to defend it, that aeronautical engineering is a 
    religion and we can seek the same privileges for Omnian theology as aircraft 
    design has). Hence, it must be that the 'hypothesis' that aircraft 
    are borne through the air has the same standing in science as aerodynamics 
    does. </p>
  <p>How then can we explain the singular lack of contribution 
    by Omnian theology to aircraft design, manufacture, and operation? How does 
    the <i>Book of Om</i> help air industry economists 
    maximise fuel use and prevent accidents? In what way can Om's minions 
    be appeased to make air travel better? Why don't Omnian 'minion 
    scientists' publish in scientific journals?</p>
  <p>The obvious answer is that there is a conspiracy of fraud, 
    silence, and greed by aeronautical engineers to gain as much research money 
    as they can. To attain this, they freeze out Omnian 'minion science' 
    by making aerodynamics orthodoxy a test of competence and so limit access 
    to publications and funding grants. Even when attempts are made to set up 
    a Minion Discovery Institute at a regional university, those conspiratorial 
    frauds that masquerade as scientists object and force its founders to adhere 
    to the 'standards' of the fake orthodoxy. But the Minion Hypothesis 
    will win in the end, yadda yadda yadda.</p>
  <p>This little tale of absurdity and paranoia not coincidentally 
    resembles real or actual events and people. The very same line of argument 
    is presented, suitably dressed up in academic-sounding language, by Jonathon 
    Wells in the final chapter of his <i>Icons of Evolution</i>&lt;span
lang=EN-GB&gt;. All the textbook examples (all of them?) are false (really?) and 
    so evolution is a myth. Darwinism is just a money grubbing exercise. This 
    may come as something of a surprise to evolutionary biologists, whose research 
    is being funded less and less in the face of the triumphal march of molecular 
    biology, but they are in it for the wealth, it seems. If they were <i>really</i> smart, I think they would have found some other way to make money 
    - perhaps by setting up a fake institute that panders to religiously-inspired 
    antiscience prejudice, or by running a televangelism show.</p>
  <p>The preceding chapters [<i>of the book this is a contribution 
    to - JSW</i>] have dealt with the errors and misrepresentations in Wells' 
    book. I wish to discuss Wells' claim that evolution is a 'myth'. Philosophical 
    doubts about the factuality of evolution come, in the main, from non-scientists 
    such as Phillip Johnson (1991, a law professor), and William Dembski (1998, 
    a philosophy graduate). But Wells is different - he has a degree in biology. 
    That he got it at the instruction of his religious leader, the Rev. Sun Myung 
    Moon of the Worldwide Unification Church, in order to discredit evolution 
    before he had even reviewed the evidence, and that his first degree is in 
    theology from that denomination<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>[1]&lt;/a&gt;, is relevant only to his motivations. The issue 
    is whether he, as a biologist, can maintain that evolution is not a fact. 
    The answer is that he can do this only through an enormous amount of bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;
  <p>'Evolution' is really a number of theories, 
    and those theories, like all science, change from time to time, so that what 
    is being spoken of must be indexed to the date. We will attend here to modern 
    theories. Moreover, unlike a religion under central control, science is actually 
    not a set of doctrines to which assent is required. Some scientists disagree 
    with other scientists in their own discipline. So there is some play in evolutionary 
    theories. This must be borne in mind. The simple fact that scientists aren't 
    100% in agreement is not evidence against an entire discipline such as evolutionary 
    biology (or it is evidence against any science whatsoever).</p>
  <p>When Wells attacks 'evolution', there is a strong 
    implication that if there is trouble in an example with selection as in the 
    peppered moth case, there is trouble for the whole of evolutionary biology. 
    We therefore need to be clear about what 'evolution' really is. 
    The main evolutionary theories of today are three: the theory of phylogenetic 
    common descent, the theory of modern population genetics, and the theory of 
    selection. These are not independent theories, but neither are they identical. 
    Problems with any one of them is not immediately a problem with all of them. 
    Let us consider each in turn.</p>
  <p>The word 'phylogeny' means a tree of descent. 
    The idea is that things that are closely related in the living world are so 
    because they evolved from common ancestral species. Common descent is offered 
    as an explanation of biological relationships, as well as of the distribution 
    of organisms. In 1855, a few years before the <i>Origin of Species</i>&lt;span
lang=EN-GB&gt; was published, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper in which he 
    asserted that new species always come into existence next to their nearest 
    relatives. This pattern is explained also by common descent.</p>
  <p>Modern population genetics is the fusion of biometrics (the 
    statistics of populations of organisms), Mendel's theory of heredity 
    (that traits are passed on as independent factors) and molecular biology. 
    One of the outcomes of this discipline is that we can expect under certain 
    circumstances that populations will differ in their genetic makeup, and that 
    with other processes taken into account (mutation, recombination of genes 
    through mating, etc), populations can be expected to evolve. One of the ways 
    this can happen is through chance (random genetic drift); another is by our 
    third theory:</p>
  <p>Selection is the 'mechanism' of evolution. More 
    accurately, it is the name we give to the process of the ways in which different 
    traits will end up in different frequencies in a population depending on how 
    the bearers of those traits do at reproducing because of the way those organisms 
    live in their environments. There are several flavors of selection: artificial, 
    sexual and natural. The first is what breeders do, and it was on the parallel 
    with this that Darwin developed his theory of selection. Sexual selection 
    is evolution driven by mate choices. And natural selection is everything else 
    that determines the frequencies of traits (other than drift).</p>
  <p>Now all of these theories have a large body of evidence, 
    experimentation and discussion both at the philosophical level and at the 
    scientific level. Phylogeny is routinely debated in the sense that it is discussed 
    whether the evidence supports a particular reconstruction of the history of 
    some group. But the debates about whether common descent is a good explanation 
    of relatedness, or affinity as it was once called, was held a century and 
    a half ago, and despite attempts to revisit it by creationists, not a single 
    biologist doubts that <i>some</i> common ancestry 
    explains why species are similar (Brooks and McLennan 
    1991; Sober 1994). This is because the hypothesis 
    not only explains, but it predicts. It predicts, for example, that if a particular 
    enzyme plays a functional role in two mammalian species such as mice and monkeys, 
    it almost certainly does in humans. All of medical research is predicated 
    on this assumption.</p>
  <p>The mechanisms of genetics are now so ordinary in science 
    that to doubt them is to invite comparisons with the crackpot fringe. We manipulate 
    genes, identify them and predict their behavior in populations. We can debate 
    whether two particular traits are homologous if the genes are different, or 
    two particular genes are homologous if their effects differ, but we cannot 
    doubt that there are any homologies due to descent at all. Conceptual difficulties 
    in a term - and there are some serious ones in the case of 'homology' (Hall 
    1999; Hall 1994) - are quite common in science and 
    are not evidence of the falsity of a theory that uses it in biology or any 
    other science. Mostly, conceptual confusion is the domain of philosophers.</p>
  <p>Natural selection is debated by scientists (Williams 
    1992). Some think it is the single most important 
    mechanism of evolution. Others think it is a major but not sole mechanism. 
    <i>Nobody</i> doubts that if a trait is adaptive that 
    it is the result of selection in whole or main part. There is a century and 
    a half of solid experimentation on selection. It is a major factor in drug 
    development, disease management, and recently in engineering. One book (Bell 1996) summarised the biological evidence 
    and experimentation for selection in hundreds of pages of terse description. 
    Is <i>all</i> of this in doubt if Kettlewell placed 
    two butterflies on a tree trunk to illustrate the differences in camouflage? 
    Thousands of experiments, including the classic ones of John Endler on Jamaican 
    guppies, or the Grants on Darwin's finches in the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands 
    (Weiner 1994) - all 
    this is discredited if a single example in textbooks is false? Really. Anyone 
    who thinks that either fails to understand science and evidence, or understands 
    all right but hopes disingenuously that their audience doesn't. Cynical 
    though it may be, I can only think that Wells is in the latter camp, since 
    he has a biological education. He should know how science operates.</p>
  <p>Let us assume, contrary to the evidence presented in the 
    previous chapters, that Wells is right about every single example and that 
    the textbooks he 'grades' do in fact perpetuate myths. Is evolution 
    then not a fact? What a textbook is designed for is teaching, not research. 
    Research papers get published in the technical journals and anthologies, which 
    are aimed at those already competent in the disciplines. Textbooks aim to 
    get ideas over so that graduates are capable of <i>understanding</i> 
    the technical literature. But before somebody becomes a professional biologist 
    they have long since left textbooks behind. If it turned out that every example 
    or idea in the undergraduate textbook were flawed in some way, the graduate 
    would still be prepared for the science, because education comes from teachers. 
    By the time a student is in third year, they only refer to textbooks on subjects 
    they don't know much about. Of course, the profession would not permit 
    a textbook that was completely flawed to be used to teach (although I suppose 
    a clever teacher could use a textbook of, say, the 1930s, to teach modern 
    biology by pointing out the differences to the technical literature). So the 
    existence of false examples in textbooks is not in itself enough to discredit 
    the discipline. Textbooks are like flowers on the tree of a science - most 
    of the substance is behind them and relatively independent of them, and textbooks, 
    like flowers, are there for propagation not growth.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  <p>Wells' attack is a small-minded and fundamentally antiscience approach to 
    one of the most sublime examples of human endeavor. He is not basing his criticisms 
    on reason by appealing to experience or evidence; he is appealing to emotions 
    through rhetoric. This is not a book that seeks truth, but one which runs 
    from it. His supporting website for example, at the date of writing has a 
    downloadable set of labels to be printed out on standard laser labels and 
    placed on textbooks 'warning' the reader of errors.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span>[3]&lt;/a&gt; The instructions state that of course these labels 
    should only be used on copies owned by the user, but if Wells thinks that 
    people who routinely glue pages of textbooks together in university and school 
    libraries will respect this injunction, he is na&iuml;ve<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span>[4]&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I find it hard to accept 
    that he thought they would, and that the injunction is there just to cover 
    him and his publishers legally, and if that is so, this is bad faith of the 
    worst kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  <p>Who exactly is Wells writing to in <i>Icons</i>&lt;span
lang=EN-GB&gt;? It is clearly not going to sway a single informed and educated scientist, 
    so it is hardly a call to reform science. Even those who are well-read amateurs 
    of evolutionary theory are going to see this book for what it is, so it can 
    only be aimed at one or both of two audiences: the choir and the influential. 
    It preaches to the choir and so it reinforces the satisfied glow of ignorance 
    with a veneer of respectable scholarship, which the choir are ill equipped 
    to see through. And it also seeks to sway populist politicians, primarily 
    but not exclusively in the United States, against the funding and teaching 
    of evolutionary science.</p>
  <p>What sort of a mark would we give 'standard' 
    anti-evolutionary textbooks if we used the criteria of science rather than 
    the superficial and emotive criteria Wells has used? Not one of them is designed 
    to increase knowledge about biology. Indeed, all of them are designed to cast 
    doubt on any aspects of biology that do not suit them on no other basis than 
    the authority of their philosophy or religion. There is no research program 
    other than a vaguely stated 'find design' injunction. There is 
    no respect for evidence or experiment. The mark has to be the lowest possible - in my day it would have been NP, a no-pass, but let us call a digging 
    implement a shovel: Wells and his colleagues fail outright.</p>
  <p>The entire case brought against evolutionary biology by 
    Wells and those he draws upon is a negative one. It consists of finding 'difficulties' 
    rather than in doing any actual scientific work, and neither he nor anyone 
    he relies upon seeks to advance knowledge. He achieves his true goals by calling 
    facts 'myths'. There is no shred of reasonable doubt in the mind of any specialists 
    that the three main hypotheses of evolution - phylogeny, genetics, or selection 
    - are facts. Each has been <i>observed</i> to occur. 
    New species have been seen to split off from existing ones, gene frequencies 
    have changed and mutations (yes, some of them 'beneficial') have been seen, 
    and selection has repeatedly been observed, measured, predicted correctly, 
    and even experimentally reproduced. In science, a hypothesis 'graduates' to 
    a fact when it is observed or is made to happen in as little as a single case. 
    Under no honest or charitable interpretation can 'evolution' be called a 'myth 
    - and certainly not on such vague, misleading and question-begging grounds 
    as Wells uses.</p>
  <p>Om would be pleased if one of his apologists could do as 
    well as Wells. But planes would still fly, and life still evolves through 
    natural selection, common descent, and the known workings of genetics.</p>
