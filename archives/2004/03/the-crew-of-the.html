<p><strong>Ed Brayton</strong> is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.michigancitizensforscience.org">Michigan Citizens for Science</a>. He is the group’s resident non-academic, being a businessman and concerned citizen with a longstanding interest in this issue.  [<a href="mailto:NE4YA14D2UIG1lkR60xAEFoJ">Email</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Reed Cartwright</strong> holds a PhD in genetics at the University of Georgia, a B.S. in genetics, and an A.B. in Latin from UGA as well.

<p><strong>Mike Dunford</strong> has been a contributor to talk.origins for so long that he  almost doesn’t feel like the new kid on the block any more. Currently, Mike is an Nth year senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he is (finally) completing his B.S. in Zoology. Following completion of his undergraduate work, he plans to continue to study evolution in island environments (especially ones with good beaches). Current interests include speciation processes in sympatric populations, and the evolution of introduced species. In the past, he has worked as a paleontological lab technician. Other interests include the history of geology, especially in 19th century England.</p>

<p><strong>Wesley R. Elsberry</strong> is a biologist with an eclectic academic and work history. He holds a B.S. in Zoology (U. Fl.), an M.S.C.S.  (Computer Science, U. Tx. at Arlington), and a Ph.D. in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences (Tx. A&amp;M U.). He has worked in biological, medical, and veterinary research; software design and development for military contractors; and photojournalism and studio photography.  His research interests include the physiology and bioenergetics of dolphin biosonar sound production, the hearing of marine mammals, bioacoustics, animal behavior, and emergent computation (artificial neural systems, evolutionary computation). He became interested in the evolution/creation controversy in 1986 after attending a young-earth creationist lecture at the University of Florida.  Since then, Wesley has become more involved in the issue, finally “turning pro” late in 2003 by becoming the Information Project Director for the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org">National Center for Science Education</a>. His views as expressed at The Panda’s Thumb are his own and are not necessarily shared by NCSE, its employees, or its supporters.  [<a href="mailto:Rl897l475k0mA14D2UIG1lkR60xAEFoJ">Email</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Jim Foley</strong> is a software engineer from Canberra, Australia, who has been fascinated by creationism since encountering it at university.

<p><strong>Pim van Meurs</strong> – [Bio pending.]</p>

<p><strong>Ian Musgrave</strong> is a biomedical researcher and University lecturer from Australia. His current area of research is into a protein so obscure that only four other people actually belive it exists. He is also researching Alzheimer’s disease, for reasons he can’t currently remember. In a career that has spanned 25 years, Ian has counted kangaroo poo in western Queensland, dug up beet root in the Darling Downs, lost an entire herd of cattle in an experimental tropical grass paddock, and measured the hight of sand dunes on Frazer Island. It is generally felt that he can do the least harm studying obscure proteins away from normal people. When not researching obscure proteins or obsessively tracking down long out-of-date publications on peppered moths, Ian is an amateur astronomer, bushwalker and aficionado of folk music, often combining all 3 three activities at folk music camps in the bush.  [<a href="mailto:OEUD20gM1VEJ4lQH9H0F3kc54UQQ7FUDH44R5E++">Email</a>]</p>

<p><strong>PZ Myers</strong> is an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota-Morris. He holds a B.S. in zoology from the University of Washington and a PhD in biology from the Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Oregon. He has previously taught at the University of Utah and at Temple University.  [<a href="mailto:Q0cuA14D2UIG1lkR60xAEFoJ">Email</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Henry Neufeld</strong> – [Bio pending.]</p>

<p><strong>Mark Perakh</strong> is a professor of physics (emeritus) and perhaps by far the oldest (agewise) contributor to this blog. He got his two doctoral degrees (one in technical/engineering physics and the other in electrochemistry) in the former USSR. He has taught physics and related disciplines for more than half a century in four countries, and lives in the US since 1978. He has authored about 300 scientific papers, four books, and scores of articles on political and sociological topics published in several languages, no to mention a novel and short stories published both in Russian and English. He was awarded prizes for his scientific work, including those from the Academy of Sciences in the USSR, DAAD (the German authority on R&amp;D) and the Royal Society of London. He became interested in debunking first the Bible code fallacy, then the publications of religious writers purportedly proving the compatibility of the Bible with science, and finally the ID concepts, after his retirement. So far he has published several articles and a book <em>Unintelligent Design</em> (Prometheus Books, 2004) in this vein. His lifelong hobby has been mountain climbing (Pamir, Alai, Tien-Shan, Caucasus), plus collecting Russian (and occasionally non-Russian) oral jokes, and writing a little of poetry in Russian.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Reuland</strong> is a PhD student in biochemistry and molecular biology at the Medical University of South Carolina.  He holds a B.S. in Biology from the College of Charleston.</p>

<p><strong>Jason Rosenhouse</strong> received his PhD in mathematics from Dartmouth College in 2000.  He spent three years as a post-doc at Kansas State University and is currently an assistant professor at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.  He has written essays on Evolution/ID for several journals including BioScience, Evolution, and The Mathematical Intelligencer.</p>

<p><strong>Timothy Sandefur</strong> is an attorney in Placerville, California, specializing in constitutional law. He is a contributing editor for Liberty magazine, and blogs regularly at <a href="http://sandefur.blogspot.com">Freespace</a>. He holds a JD from Chapman University School of law and a BA in Political Economy from Hillsdale College. He is a fellow in the College of Public Interest Law at the Pacific Legal Foundation, and was a 2002 Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute. In law school, he wrote a student note on the Establishment Clause implications of the accreditation of the Institute for Creation Research’s graduate school. (Dinosaur TRACS: The Approaching Conflict between Establishment Clause Jurisprudence and College Accreditation Procedures, 7 Nexus J. Op. 79 (2002)). His views as expressed on Panda’s Thumb are solely his own and do not in any way represent those of the Pacific Legal Foundation, its employees, clients, or supporters.</p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Shallit</strong> received his AB in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1979 and his Ph. D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983.  Since then he has taught at the University of Chicago and Dartmouth College. He is currently Professor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.  He has a long interest in pseudoscience and pseudomathematics and has written about the intelligent design movement in Reports of the NCSE and the forthcoming book, <em>Why Intelligent Design Fails</em>(Edis and Young, eds.)</p>

<p><strong>Tara C. Smith</strong> is an assistant professor of Epidemiology at the University of Iowa.  She holds a B.S. in Biology from Yale University.  A “temporary” stint as a technician led to a Ph.D. in microbial pathogenesis and virulence factor regulation in <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A streptococcus) at the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo.  She completed post-doctoral training in molecular epidemiology at the University  of Michigan.  Her current research centers on investigation of hypervariable proteins in the group B streptococcus, <em>S. agalactiae</em>. Other interests include microbial ecology, emerging diseases, zoonoses, and infectious causes of chronic disease.  In addition to publishing in scientific journals, she has written books on the topics of group A strep and Ebola.  She lives in rural Iowa with her husband and 2 young children.
