  <p>I would like to announce the existence of a <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">new Resources page</a> on NCSE’s website: the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">NCSE Resources page on <em>Of Pandas and People</em></a>.  NCSE had a large amount of material in its files on <em>Pandas</em>, but almost none of it was digital, so good resources on the web were few and far between.  I took this on as a project, and have now digitized just about everything published in <em>NCSE Reports</em> or <em>Bookwatch Reviews</em> on <em>Pandas</em> in 1989 and throughout the 1990’s, and put it in <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">one handy central location</a> for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0914513400.01._PIdp-schmooS,TopRight,7,-26_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" /> Many of the reviews have never been available on the web before, including Frank Sonleitner’s epic “What’s Wrong With <em>Pandas</em>?”, a review which is actually longer than the book itself (the images in Sonleitner’s document are not up yet since there may be copyright issues).  Various minor touch-up work still needs to be done on the collection – manual transcription and document conversion to HTML are not error-free processes – but on the whole it should be quite useable.  Please alert me to any typos, formatting errors, etc., that you detect (send to matzkeATncseweb.org).</p>

<p>Hopefully this material will be useful to the folks in Pennsylvania.  However, since the last edition of <em>Pandas</em> is now 11 years old, it seems more likely that future controversies will occur over the fabled third edition of <em>Pandas</em>, apparently now <a href="http://www.designinference.com/">retitled <em>The Design of Life</em></a>.  Whatever the title, it will be useful to have some of the long and interesting history of <em>Pandas</em>, and thereby intelligent design, online and available to the public.</p>

<p>The page can be reached via NCSE homepage –&gt; Resources –&gt; Of Pandas and People, or simply <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21</a>.</p>

<p>To give a fuller overview, I’ll post the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8442_1_introduction_iof_pandas__11_23_2004.asp">Introduction</a> I wrote for the page, and the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">Table of Contents</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8442_1_introduction_iof_pandas__11_23_2004.asp">Introduction</a>:</p>

<p>The creationist textbook <em>Of Pandas and People</em> was published in 1989 (the second and last edition was published in 1993). This was the first book to frequently use now-common buzzwords such as “intelligent design,” “design proponents,” and “design theory.” As such, Pandas represents the beginning of the modern “intelligent design” movement.</p>

<p>This fact is obscured in most recountings of the Intelligent Design (ID) movement, which usually credit Phillip Johnson’s book <em>Darwin on Trial</em> and subsequent books by Behe (<em>Darwin’s Black Box</em>, 1996) and Dembski (<em>The Design Inference</em>, 1998) as building the intellectual foundation of the scientific movement of Intelligent Design. In fact, all of the basic arguments of these ID proponents are found in essentially modern form in the 1989 <em>Of Pandas and People</em> (Behe’s irreducibly complexity argument is found in the 1993 edition of <em>Pandas</em>). The textbook came first, and the “research” to support it came many years later. Thus, if ID ever does succeed, it will be the first movement in the history of science that began in a high school textbook and then “filtered up” to acceptance by the scientific research community.</p>

<p><em>Pandas</em> was actively promoted for public school use by creationists, starting in Alabama in 1989 and continuing throughout the 1990’s. After 2000, <em>Pandas</em> activity largely died down (the last edition having been published in 1993), but in 2004 the school board in Dover, Pennsylvania accepted an anonymous donation of 50 (or maybe 60) copies of the <em>Pandas</em> book, now 11 years old. The board subsequently passed a policy mandating the teaching of ID, attracting national media attention.</p>

<p>The Dover event prompted NCSE to dust off its old <em>Pandas</em> files, including book reviews and descriptions of previous <em>Pandas</em> battles in <em>NCSE Reports</em>. They are <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">presented here</a> in digital form in the interests of making readers more aware of this foundational, but little-known, episode in the history of intelligent design.</p>
