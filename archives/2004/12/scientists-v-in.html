  <h2 id="biology-department-rejects-intelligent-design">Biology Department rejects intelligent design</h2>

  <p>On National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation Science Friday program of November 19, GU Law Professor David DeWolf participated in a discussion on teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. Although Professor DeWolf is on the faculty of Gonzaga University Law School, his views on intelligent design do not represent those of the University as a whole. In particular, the faculty of the Biology Department at Gonzaga are unanimous in their acceptance of evolutionary theory as a fundamental underlying tenet of the science of biology. The principles of evolution are as well-established as any other body of scientific knowledge, and a full and correct appreciation for those principles is necessary for understanding the nature of life. Intelligent design is not a scientific alternative to evolution. The flaws in the idea of intelligent design have been amply and publicly exposed, and the Biology Department feels that the teaching of intelligent design has no place in a science curriculum at any level.</p>

  <p>Regarding the reinstatement of proper teaching guidelines for the teaching of Geological and Biological Sciences</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, it is a responsibility of the Ohio educators to present science and encourage scientific inquiry; and</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, science is a systematic method of continuing investigation, based on observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, and theory building, which leads to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena, explanations that are open to further testing, revision, and falsification, and while not “believed in” through faith may be accepted or rejected on the basis of evidence; and</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, the theory of evolution, as presently developed, fully satisfies these criteria, especially when its teaching considers the remaining debates concerning its detailed mechanisms; and</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, a recent decision by the State Board of Education establishes a module for the “critical assessment of evolution,” which simultaneously attacks the theory itself and facilitates the introduction of pseudo-scientific approaches such as “Creationism” or “Intelligent Design,” which have no scientific validity,</p>

  <p><strong>THEREFORE, BE IT ]RESOLVED</strong> that the Ohio Faculty Council supports legislation reversing the State Board’s decision and restoring genuine science education to the state’s public school curricula, and</p>

  <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong> that the Ohio Faculty Council urges citizens, educational authorities, and legislators to oppose any alteration of the science curriculum or state proficiency tests in science that would in any way accommodate approaches based on either religious beliefs or other sources that are not amenable to the scientific process of scrutiny, testing, and revision.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2002/1106id.shtml">AAAS Board Resolution Urges Opposition to “Intelligent Design” Theory in U.S. Science Classes </a> American Association for the Advancement of Science</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contemporary theory of biological evolution is one of the most robust products of scientific inquiry. It is the foundation for research in many areas of biology as well as an essential element of science education. To become informed and responsible citizens in our contemporary technological world, students need to study the theories and empirical evidence central to current scientific understanding.</p>

  <p>Over the past several years proponents of so-called “intelligent design theory,” also known as ID, have challenged the accepted scientific theory of biological evolution. As part of this effort they have sought to introduce the teaching of “intelligent design theory” into the science curricula of the public schools. The movement presents “intelligent design theory” to the public as a theoretical innovation, supported by scientific evidence, that offers a more adequate explanation for the origin of the diversity of living organisms than the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution. In response to this effort, individual scientists and philosophers of science have provided substantive critiques of “intelligent design,” demonstrating significant conceptual flaws in its formulation, a lack of credible scientific evidence, and misrepresentations of scientific facts.</p>

  <p>Recognizing that the “intelligent design theory” represents a challenge to the quality of science education, the Board of Directors of the AAAS unanimously adopts the following resolution:</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, ID proponents claim that contemporary evolutionary theory is incapable of explaining the origin of the diversity of living organisms;</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, to date, the ID movement has failed to offer credible scientific evidence to support their claim that ID undermines the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution;</p>

  <p><em>WHEREAS</em>, the ID movement has not proposed a scientific means of testing its claims;</p>

  <p><strong>Therefore Be It Resolved</strong>, that the lack of scientific warrant for so-called “intelligent design theory” makes it improper to include as a part of science education;</p>

  <p><strong>Therefore Be Further It Resolved</strong>, that AAAS urges citizens across the nation to oppose the establishment of policies that would permit the teaching of “intelligent design theory” as a part of the science curricula of the public schools;</p>

  <p><strong>Therefore Be It Further Resolved</strong>, that AAAS calls upon its members to assist those engaged in overseeing science education policy to understand the nature of science, the content of contemporary evolutionary theory and the inappropriateness of “intelligent design theory” as subject matter for science education;</p>

  <p><strong>Therefore Be Further It Resolved</strong>, that AAAS encourages its affiliated societies to endorse this resolution and to communicate their support to appropriate parties at the federal, state and local levels of the government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsst.org/grantsburg.asp">To the Grantsburg School Board</a>
Over 350 educators signed the following letter to the Grantsburg School board</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As science teachers and members of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers (WSST), we are writing to you because we are concerned about the recent action the Grantsburg School Board has taken with respect to the teaching of evolution in the Grantsburg Schools. First, permit us to introduce ourselves. WSST was founded in 1958 and with a current membership of almost 2,000, we are the largest organization in Wisconsin devoted to the advancement of science education. Our purpose is to promote, support and improve science education in the state of Wisconsin by providing leadership, advocacy, and programs to enhance the teaching and learning of science. WSST is a chapter of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), long a leader in science education nationally.</p>

  <p>The motion recently adopted by the Grantsburg Board, “When theories of origin are taught, students will study various scientific models/theories of origins and identify the scientific data supporting each,” is, in our professional opinion, terribly misguided. To our knowledge, the only viable scientific theory in this area is the theory of evolution. Your motion, by its simple presence, implies that the Board believes that there are other, competing scientific theories. The fact that your motion is limited to “theories of origin” and not to the entirety of science, similarly suggests that the Board has something specific in mind with respect to the teaching of “origins.”</p>

  <p>We encourage you to closely examine the NSTA position statement on The Teaching of Evolution. This statement can be viewed on the web at:</p>

  <p>http://www.nsta.org/main/pdfs/PositionStatement_Evolution.pdf</p>

  <p>The statement says quite clearly that “evolution has not been emphasized in science curricula in a manner commensurate to its importance because of official policies, intimidation of science teachers, the general public’s misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, and a century of controversy. In addition, teachers are being pressured to introduce creationism, ‘creation science,’ and other nonscientific views, which are intended to weaken or eliminate the teaching of evolution.” The statement goes on to say that “evolution is a unifying concept for science,” and points out that “scientific disciplines with a historical component, such as astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology, cannot be taught with integrity if evolution is not emphasized.”</p>

  <p>With respect to “alternative” views, the statement says, “‘Creation science’ is a religious effort to support special creationism through methods of science. Teachers are often pressured to include it or other related nonscientific views such as ‘abrupt appearance theory,’ ‘initial complexity theory,’ ‘arguments against evolution,’ or ‘intelligent design theory’ when they teach evolution. Scientific creationist claims have been discredited by the available scientific evidence. They have no empirical power to explain the natural world and its diverse phenomena. Instead, creationists seek out supposed anomalies among many existing theories and accepted facts. Furthermore, ‘creation science’ claims do not lead to new discoveries of scientific knowledge.”</p>

  <p>We can well believe that you may have passed your motion in the belief that doing so would encourage critical thinking skills among your students. If this is the case, we believe your motion is wide of the mark because there is no way students can learn critical thinking skills when they are told that nonscientific material has an underlying scientific basis. Rather than introducing students to critical thinking skills, we believe that such instruction will simply confuse them about the very nature of science. Given the large number of vitally important scientific issues currently confronting our society, confusion of this sort cannot be in society’s best interest. Additionally, we fear that your students will simply not be able to effectively compete academically in college with students who have been exposed to high quality science instruction in high school.</p>

  <p>Please remember that WSST is a non-partisan, non-political group whose sole interest lies in promoting high quality science instruction throughout Wisconsin. Our letter is intended to bring information to your attention about which we believe you may be unaware. Our hope is that you will rescind your motion and not interfere in the science curriculum.</p>

  <p>Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. We hope to be hearing from you in the near future.</p>

  <p>Wisconsin academics are rallying to reverse a decision last month by a local school board that would require students to “study various scientific models/theories of origins” rather than stick with Darwinian theory only.</p>

  <p>The Grantsburg school board’s action spurred Michael Zimmerman, dean of the College of Letters and Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, to organize a flurry of letter writing by hundreds of scientists and theologians from universities around the state as well as high school science teachers. “We want to send as a strong a message as we can,” says Zimmerman. Although Wisconsin state standards mandate the teaching of evolution, the board contends that the district has a right to make the standards more “inclusive.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On October 18, Zimmerman and 42 fellow deans sent a letter to the Grantsburg school board and superintendent of schools. The letter urged the school board to withdraw the policy and advised that “alternative theories” consist of misinformed, spurious attacks on evolution combined with misleading, simplistic versions of evolutionary theory. A second letter signed by over 300 biology and religious studies faculty from 43 institutions of higher learning, both public and private, from across Wisconsin was sent on November 1.</p>

  <p>More than 450 Missouri scientists and educators have endorsed a statement (see below) opposing the teaching of “intelligent design,” a form of creationism, in public school science classes. Intelligent design is the idea that the biological world is so complex that it can only be explained by reference to a “designer,” not necessarily a divine being. Missouri House Bill 911, filed by Rep. Robert Wayne Cooper of Camdenton, would mandate equal treatment for intelligent design alongside biological evolution in public elementary and secondary schools, including classes in “Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Health, Physiology, Genetics, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Anthropology, Ecology, and Climatology.”</p>

  <h2 id="the-statement">The Statement</h2>

  <h2 id="lets-teach-science-in-science-classes">Let’s Teach Science in Science Classes</h2>

  <p>Missouri House Bill 911 wants to change the Education statutes to mandate the teaching of “intelligent design” creationism alongside Darwinian evolution in public school science classes. Missourians of all persuasions should reject this attempt to force non-science into the science curriculum.</p>

  <p>Proponents of Intelligent Design advertise it as an “alternative” to biological evolution. Advocates of HB911 frame their argument in terms of fairness, pointing out that it is necessary to teach all sides of a controversy. If the controversy about Darwinian evolution vs. Intelligent Design were truly scientific, we would enthusiastically support its inclusion in the curriculum. As educators, we know that one of the best ways to engage students in studying science is to present them with an unsolved problem. Look at how the current search for evidence of past life on Mars excites students at all levels.</p>

  <p>Intelligent Design, however, isn’t science. The characteristics of science that are accepted in U.S. law derive from a 1982 court decision, McLean vs Arkansas Board of Education.</p>

  <p>* [T]he essential characteristics of science are:
* (1) It is guided by natural [physical or biological] law;
* (2) It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;
* (3) It is testable against the empirical world;
* (4) Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and
* (5) It is falsifiable [or, more accurately, makes predictions that can be tested by observation]</p>

  <p>Intelligent Design doesn’t meet these tests because it is a philosophical or theological perspective, not a scientific one. The Intelligent Design movement was started by a Berkeley law professor, Phillip Johnson. As Johnson’s own writings assert, anti-evolution is a “wedge” to get religious “values” inserted into the public school curriculum. Thus, the motivation behind Intelligent Design has nothing to do with advancing science.</p>

  <p>Even without considering their motives, Intelligent Design proponents haven’t shown that there is anything in it that meets the criteria for being judged as science. Intelligent Design advocates presuppose the existence of a Designer and then try to debunk existing data; science works the other way around. The Designer explicitly does not follow the known processes of physics or chemistry so it isn’t guided by, nor can it explain things by referring to physical or biological law. Intelligent Design fails to make predictions that we can test by observation or experiment. What if we found alien bacterial life on the moons of Jupiter? Would that be evidence for or against multiple instances of Design?</p>

  <p>The court left out the final, and for scientists, definitive, test of whether something is science or not. An idea is judged first by whether it leads to new experiments or observations that make sense in light of the idea. Any theory or hypothesis, no matter how attractive, is discarded if it doesn’t prove useful in this sense. Johnson started his wedge strategy over a dozen years ago, and the Intelligent Design advocates have published numerous books, position papers, essays and so on. In all that output, however, there has not been a single peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal that uses Intelligent Design as a guide to a new experimental result or observation. To the contrary, a number of claims made by the Intelligent Design advocates have been tested scientifically - and they haven’t held up. We are forced to conclude that Intelligent Design, despite all the publicity, hasn’t contributed anything to the physical or biological sciences and therefore has no place ! in the public school science classroom.</p>

  <p>By contrast, evolution through natural selection has been tested ever since Darwin proposed it. Its principles and predictions fit with our observations of the contemporary and ancient natural world. We see examples of natural selection operating at molecular, organismal and species levels at the present time. Practically, we use evolution every day: to help select drug molecules, to follow the development of new species, to explore Earth and other planets, to develop new computer algorithms and to understand the human genome. It remains a vital and exciting area of science.</p>

  <p>Missourians are working to build Life Sciences for the economic development of our state. We hope to discover new crops to feed the world, new medicines to comfort our lives and new materials that are more efficient and environmentally friendly than what we have now. Our state has important advantages in this effort: a central location, commitment and cooperation across the region, and strong educational institutions. Let’s not throw these advantages away by undermining the science education of our young people. After all, we expect them to lead the way.</p>
