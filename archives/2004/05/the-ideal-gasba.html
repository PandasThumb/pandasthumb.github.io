  <p>A colleague in passing recently 
    noted, of a committee we both endure, that &quot;work expands to fill the 
    amount of space allotted&quot;, and I casually remarked that it sounded a 
    lot like a gas.</p>

<p>This got me thinking. </p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>There is, as highschool science graduates may vaguely 
  recall, a law called the <em>Ideal Gas Law</em>, which is a combination of several 
  other laws about gases that says, basically, that pressure, temperature and 
  volume covary according to a constant for each gas.</p>
  <p >This sounds a bit more complex than it need 
    be, and even someone as unmathematical as I am can understand this - each 
    value varies against the other, with a number thrown in for the number of 
    molecules, and a constant for the gas:</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p><i>PV </i>= <i>nRT</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >or, Pressure (<i>P</i>) times Volume (<i>V</i>) equals the number of 
    molecules in the container (<i>n</i>) times a constant 
    (<i>R</i>) times the temperature (<i>T</i>).</p>
  <p >This forms a three dimensional space that 
    varies according to each gas constant <i>R</i>, 
    in which we can say how, given two values (say, the temperature and the volume) 
    we can work out what the third value (say, the pressure) is.</p>
  
<img alt="L0219.gif" src="/uploads/2005/L0219.gif" width="388" height="288" border="0" />
<p >Anyway, enough <i>real </i>science. We are considering the science of committees. 
  Committees have a number of &quot;laws&quot; attached to them, some of the best 
  being summarised by the BBC's wonderful series from the 1980s, <i><a href="http://www.yes-minister.com/introduc.htm" target="_blank">Yes, 
  Minister </a></i><a href="http://www.yes-minister.com/introduc.htm">and <i>Yes, 
  Prime Minister</i>,</a> in which the hapless politician Jim Hacker is instructed 
  in the ways of the British Civil Service. One rule, never to be forgotten, is 
  that whoever writes the minutes, controls what happened and what was decided.</p>
  <p >Back to our law... a committee is, in a very 
    real sense, a collection of particles that like gas particles under the Ideal 
    Gas Law bounce off each other. I have been to several meetings where this 
    was not a metaphor, but I no longer work for local government or trade unions. 
    Perhaps the Ideal Gas Law has an analogy in the behavior of committees.</p>
  <p >Gases expand to fill the space of their containers; 
    so do committees. Gases become energetic when heat is applied; so do committees. 
    Gases become agitated when the pressure is applied; and so do committees. 
    There must be something to this.</p>
  <p >Let us therefore see if we can make this 
    work. Our equation is</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p><i>PV </i>= <i>nRT</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ><i>P </i>is pressure, that 
    is clear. Nobody who has ever worked in a committee can fail to note the occasional 
    application of pressure from without - and the more pressure applied, from 
    those who rely on its achievements (poor sods), the more activity results. 
    Not, necessarily, actual work, for just like a boiler, a committee can be 
    harnessed or allowed to run furiously in one place, venting steam.</p>
  <p ><i>V</i>, or volume in the case 
    of gases, is the space and resources allowed for the committee to do the work 
    it is set up to do. A good many committees are given very little room to move, 
    or too few members (<i>n </i>in the equation) to do it with. You will get 
    no effect if the number of molecules in the container is but a handful. Likewise 
    we know that understaffed committees are unable to do much.</p>
  <p >Some committees are staffed by <i>n</i>s from other containers (sorry, committees) which means that when they 
    are in another committee doing work there, they are unavailable for work in 
    this one. So far the analogy is holding.</p>
  <p >We know what <i>T </i>is 
    - it is the heat applied to the gas, and equally to the committee. When management 
    or staff or regulatory bodies really <i>do </i>want work out of the boiler, err, committee, they use metaphors like &quot;apply 
    the blowtorch&quot; or &quot;put a fire under it&quot;. We might very well 
    be dealing with the steam trains of the past here.</p>
  <p >But what is <i>R</i>? 
    What is the constant that determines how the committee will react? I suggest 
    that it is the chairman (a term derived not from any gender-related language, 
    but from the Latin term for <i>hand</i>, lest you think I am perpetuating 
    the paternalistic hegemony. Well, I do that too, but only in my spare time). 
    The ability of a chairman to constrain or direct behaviour, or in other words 
    &quot;stand firm&quot; is to committeers what atomic number is to molecules.</p>
  <p >So, Asimov's <i>psychohistory</i>, so long the domain of science fiction, has finally begun. We can make 
    some predictions about how committees will behave so long as we can isolate 
    the values of each variable. This will, I put it to you, help management, 
    government and industry no end. And as originator of this law, which I dub 
    the <i>Ideal Gasbag Law</i>, I get a 2% royalty of the profit each time 
    it is used in the social engineering of modern society. I'll call you from 
    the Caymans, I promise.</p>
  <p >But there's more, as there ought to be for any good scientific 
    explanation. First of all, there is the way the physical law fails. No gas 
    <i>is </i>and ideal gas - molecules will stick 
    together under weak forces at low temperatures and high pressures. Eventually 
    they can become liquids (and thus uncontainable unless you have a non-porous, 
    or legally binding, container), or even solids. We all have experience of 
    committees which have not met or made a decision in years. The only thing 
    to do with frozen gases like steam is put them in alcohol (preferably 20 year 
    old scotch), and the same thing applies here, too. They may as well be used 
    for something, even if only entertainment.</p>
  <p >Moreover, at high temperatures, gases sublimate or even 
    become totally different - plasma in many cases. This is a highly dangerous 
    form of matter - it can cut through steel containers and American legal contracts, 
    and is to be used only by experts, such as NASA or the CIA. In either case, 
    at the extremes the gas fails to apply the law properly, something also true 
    of the CIA. People are not uniform hard particles. They have soft squishy 
    bits that make a mockery of simple laws. Remember that.</p>
  <p >Also, we can use this law to do useful work - the laws 
    of thermodynamics allow engineers (and here, corporate executives, or, in 
    the case of democratic governments or military organisations, corporate executives) 
    to design systems to do work. A steam engine is one such engine. So too is 
    a committee employed efficiently, like a lobby group or a Star Chamber.</p>
  <p >So we can now begin to take matters in hand, armed with 
    this law, and begin to bring justice and equity to accounts departments everywhere. 
    Particularly mine. Leave the cheque under the mat, thanks. And if anyone wants 
    an ideal gasbag, I can name a few, in private, though I'll deny doing so in 
    a court of law. Cheers.</p>
