  <p>Hmmm. Let's see. Intelligent Design creationists made a big push in Minnesota. They had a friendly education commissioner who stacked the deck in their favor, and when the sensible scientists, educators, and citizens who wrote the science standards came up with a darn good document, she formed a special committee of creationists to put together revisions. End result: <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/688_0_1_0_C/">the revisions were scrapped, and our conservative stealth creationist commissioner finds herself thrown out on her ear</a>.</p>

<p>Sounds like a defeat for Intelligent Design to me.</p>

<p>But no! How could I be so deluded? The <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2043&amp;program=News-CSC&amp;callingPage=discoMainPage">Discovery Institute has declared it a <em>victory</em></a>!</p>

<blockquote><p>Minnesota has become the second state to require students to know about scientific evidence critical of Darwinian evolution in its newly adopted science standards. On May 15, the Minnesota legislature adopted new science standards that include a benchmark requiring students to be able to explain how new evidence can challenge existing scientific theories, including the theory of evolution.</p>
<p>The benchmark reads, "The student will be able to explain how scientific and technological innovations as well as new evidence can challenge portions of or entire accepted theories and models including  "...theory of evolution. ..." The benchmark is included in the "History and Nature of Science," strand of the science standards for grades 9-12.</p>

<p>"This is a significant victory for the vast majority of Americans who favor teaching evolution but who want it taught fully, including scientific criticisms of the theory," said Dr. John West, Associate Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Discovery Institute supports teaching students more about evolutionary theory, including introducing them to mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific debates over key aspects of modern evolutionary theory (known as neo-Darwinism).</p>

<p>Dr. West added that he expected some Darwin-only supporters would try to downplay or ignore the new benchmark. "Undoubtedly some Darwin-only supporters will claim that the standard doesn't really mean what it says, or that schools don't really need to follow it. Minnesotans who support the standard will need to make sure that it is actually implemented in Minnesota schools."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When these guys speak, you <i>know</i> they are lying. They've <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4116_evolving_banners_at_the_discov_8_29_2002.asp">changed their logo and name so many times</a>, they might as well just go straight to the most appropriate one: Ministry of Truth.</p>
