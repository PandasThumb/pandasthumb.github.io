<strong>Dating Fossils</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Although personally, evolution is a load of crock. I think the fossil records speak for themselves in that area. As does logic.  If you truly beleive that all species are evolving, and changing and that the earth is a billions of years old, explain to me why all of the species alive today can be found in the fossil record from millions of years ago. Fossils are just creatures that died in the flood and were buried. All the sediment deposits and massive lava flows and oil deposits are the remnants of a tremendous global cataclysm.  It’s that simple and that’s all you need to explain it. It isn’t complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As to the “sorting” of organisms in the layers, well, that’s an illusion too, and there are many possible non-evolutionary explanations for it.  If they’re arranged from “simple” to “complex”, then you have a very simple explanation. More complex creatures are smarter and faster than simpler ones. For example, we find lots of clams in the fossil record, down near the bottom a lot of times. Well, last time I checked, clams don’t run very fast, and they aren’t very bright, and they don’t float. They’re going to get caught on the bottom. “</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is possible that the flood produced what appears to be “MILLIONS OF YEARS” worth of sedimentation in only a few months. Runoff from the flood could have cause many of the large canyon areas we see today (remember the sediments would have still been relatively soft during the runoff period).”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As for dating fossils, these assumptions become key. C-14 dating is what has always been used to date fossils that are presumed to have once lived. The other isotopes previously stated by … , are not used to date remains of what has once lived. The ice core dating does two things. It demonstrates the fluctuation in carbon levels over time. It also is dependent on an assumption of age. “</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Radioactive dating has been proved not to work since recently deposited lava flows were dated at millions of years.. It’s all smoke and mirrors built on a lot of assumptions and guesswork. It just looks good because so many people have worked on it. You can make anything look good if you work hard enough at it. If you tell a lie long enough and loud enough, people will believe it no matter how big the lie is. That’s what evolution is, the ultimate lie, and a lie that is dragging people to hell every day. It MUST be fought against.   One possible explanation is that the rapid aging of the earth is due to relativistic time dilation (or contraction, in this case), which suggests that the earth, along with galaxies in genearl, suddenly started slowing their rate of travel in the expanding universe in relatively recent times. “</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BTW, nothing about this subject intimidates me. I am well educated too.”</p>
