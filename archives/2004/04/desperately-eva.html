  William Dembski's latest book, <i>The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest
Questions About Intelligent Design</i> consists of 44 questions about intelligent 
design with short answers by Dembski -- each answer takes about 6 or 7 pages,
on average.   
Critics of Dembski -- such as Mark Perakh --
who were looking forward to having their objections
addressed will be disappointed.
<i>The Design Revolution</i> is even more intellectually
dishonest than I thought possible.  The easy questions Dembski actually
addresses are answered disingenuously; the really hard questions he avoids
entirely.
This book should have been titled
<i>Desperately Evading the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design</i>.
<P>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

So many of Dembski's answers consist of evasion or dissembling that
it would take a book as long as Dembski's own to catalogue them all.
In this short essay I'll just list a few.
<P>

Consider chapter 5, "Religious motivation".  Dembski says "let's be      
clear that design theorists oppose Darwinian theory on strictly
scientific grounds".  With nearly every prominent intelligent design supporter
a conservative Christian, this isn't even remotely plausible.
Consider three of the leaders of the ID movement:
        <UL>
        <LI> Phillip Johnson converted to fundamentalist
Christianity after a mid-life crisis and made "Defeating Darwinism"
(part of the title of one of his books) his new mission.
<LI> Jonathan Wells <A HREF="http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/talks/wells/DARWIN.htm">
candidly admitted</A> that "Father's [Rev. Sun Myung
Moon's] words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote
my life to destroying Darwinism..."

        <LI> Dembski himself, in a <A HREF="http://fellowshipbcwaco.org/SundaySchool/Dembski_03_07_04/Bill_Dembs
ki_03_07_04.mp3">March 7, 2004 talk</A>
at the <A HREF="http://www.fellowshipbcwaco.org/">Fellowship Baptist Church</A>
 in Waco, Texas,
admitted his own  motivation is religious.
He said, "I think at a fundamental level,
in terms of what drives me in this, is that I think God's glory is being
robbed by these naturalistic approaches to biological evolution, creation,
the origin of the world, the origin of biological complexity and diversity.
When you are attributing the wonder of nature to these mindless material
mechanisms, God's glory is getting robbed."
        </UL>
<P>

 These do not sound like scientific grounds for opposing "Darwinian theory".
<P>

In a <A HREF="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000102.html">
previous article in this blog</A>, I showed how Dembski has a history
of incorrect citation of
quotations -- even when previously informed of his errors.
Here's another example.
On page 52,
Dembski writes "Nor does philosopher Daniel Dennett help matters when, in
<i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>, he recommends quarantining religious
parents who object to their children being taught evolutionary theory."
<P>

The only problem is that Dennett wrote <i>no such thing</i>.  Dennett
<i>actually</i>
wrote, on page 519,
"...those whose visions dictate that they cannot peacefully coexist
with the rest of us we will have to quarantine as best we can, minimizing
the pain and damage..."  To find the people Dennett is actually referring
to, one has to read the quotation in the context of the entire chapter.
It is those (listed on pages 516-517) who insist on slavery, child
abuse, discrimination, and fatwas on their opponents, all in the name      
of their religion.  Dennett has informed Dembski that he did not say
what Dembski attributes to him, and Dembski even
<A HREF="http://www.antievolution.org/people/mgrey/IDC/21990.html">sort-of
retracted</A> his bogus
claim in 2000.  Neverthless, it appears again in <i>The Design Revolution</i>
with no indication of the controversy.  This is the height of intellectual
dishonesty.
<P>

On page 159, Dembski contrasts the information in one copy of a text
with that in two copies.
He writes "Nor for that matter do both copies together contain more
information than any one copy individually.  The mathematics justifying
these claims is straightforward."    However, using
the definition of information most commonly used in computer science -- that
is, Kolmogorov complexity -- Dembski's claim is incorrect.  In fact, it
can easily be proved (and I have assigned it in my undergraduate course 
on computation) that there exist infinitely many strings <i>x</i> for which
there exists more Kolmogorov information in <i>xx</i> than <i>x</i>.   
Dembski was informed of this in December 2002, but he persists in making
this bogus claim.
<P>

    Any theory of information in which <i>n</i> copies of a text have     
no more information than a single copy is obviously wrong, because
one can clearly store an arbitrary amount of extra information encoded       
in the number <i>n</i> which specifies the number of copies.
<P>

Here's another example of Dembski's disingenuous answers:
On page 303, Dembski refers to some unnamed articles in scientific journals.
He claims "They are all written by design theorists and are
listed in the ISCID bibliography."  Unfortunately for anyone who wants
to check Dembski's claims, the
<A HREF="http://www.iscid.org/bibliography/bibliography.php">URL provided</A>
is not available to just anyone -- only to paying members of Dembski's own  
society, the <A HREF="http://www.iscid.org">International
 Society for Complexity, Information, and Design</A>.
What has Dembski got to hide?  Maybe those papers don't say anything
about design at all, but how could we know?
<P>

    Now let's turn to the questions that Dembski refused to address.
<P>

Let's start with the most obvious question:
<b>what, exactly, is design?</b>
You'd think this would be a basic question Dembski would have to address
in a book about "intelligent design" -- and Del Ratzsch, an ID-friendly
philosopher at Calvin College has taken the ID movement to task for
this omission -- but he doesn't.    Does design just mean pattern?  Or
is it necessarily teleological?  Neither this book, nor previous books
such as <i>No Free Lunch</i>, address this question.
<P>

Here are a few more questions Dembski doesn't address in
<i>The Design Revolution</i>:
<P>

<OL>
<LI> <b>When estimating the probability of events, why do you use two
different and incompatible
methods, depending on whether the event was human-caused or not?</b>
<BR>

As Wesley Elsberry and I have previously
<A HREF="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/eandsdembski.pdf">
pointed out</A>, when Dembski analyzes events that are clearly the
result of human agency, such as the Caputo case, he estimates
probability by assuming that events are independent and
equally likely -- he ignores the known causal history of the events.
However, when he analyzes other kinds of events, such as the generation of
the protein URF13, his
analysis is based on some hypothesized causal history.
In one case in <i>No Free Lunch</i>, he even uses two different
methods in analyzing the <i>same</i> example!
<P>

<LI> <b>Why have you never acknowledged that a crucial calculation on page
249 of <i>No Free Lunch</i> is off by about 65 orders of magnitude, even
though you were informed of this in 2002?</b>
<BR>

Dembski has a curious history of ignoring corrections.  In
a <A HREF="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000102.html">
previous article</A> on this blog, I showed how he continued to
use a quotation of Schopenhauer, even after he was informed of its very
questionable provenance.
<P>

Nearly two years ago, I told Dembski that his calculation on page 297
of <i>No Free Lunch</i>
(estimating the centered formula about a third of the way down the page)
was wrong.  The very same
calculation is also used on page 299 to estimate the "perturbation
probability for the [sic] bacterial flagellum" -- which is the
centerpiece of the book.    Now, this calculation isn't rocket science;
the formula just involves multiplying and dividing some binomial
coefficients and powers.   Even an undergraduate should be able to
perform it correctly.  But Dembski didn't.  He said this formula
evaluates to approximately 10<sup>-288</sup>, whereas it's actually about
10<sup>-223</sup>.
<P>

Now it's true that
nearly every biologist who has read Dembski's computation of the
probability of "the [sic] bacterial flagellum" has rejected it as
specious nonsense, because the formula is based on a random assembly
scenario that is wildly unrealistic.  But in addition to that, Dembski's
calculation error makes a flagellum 10<sup>65</sup> times <i>less</i> likely
than the result of his own his bogus scenario.
<P>

Even stranger for someone who has Ph. D. in mathematics, Dembski claims
his calculation is based on "Stirling's formula".  Now Stirling's formula
is a classical approximation for the factorial function, and factorials
are one way to evaluate binomial coefficients.  Indeed, Stirling's formula
would be good for a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  But there's no need
to rely on approximations for doing Dembski's calculation.  Any decent
computer algebra system, such as Maple or Mathematica, can compute the
<i>exact</i> value of the formula on page 297 -- or for that matter, the
exact value of the quotient of sums that the formula is based on --
in a matter of microseconds.
<P>

The point isn't the sloppy calculation.  The point is that Dembski
was informed of this error nearly two years ago, but he has never
acknowledged it or corrected it in any way.  Why not?  You'd think that
an error of 65 orders of magnitude in the centerpiece calculation of the
book would merit a correction <i>somewhere</i>.  For that matter,       
why is there no errata page for <i>No Free Lunch</i>?
<P>

Maybe Dembski should take his own advice, given on page 51 of
<i>The Design Revolution</i>.
There he wrote:  "How can a scientist keep from descending into
dogmatism?  The only way I know is to look oneself squarely in the mirror
and continually affirm, <i>I am a fallible human being.  I may be wrong.  
I may be massively wrong.  I may be hopelessly and irretrievably
wrong</i>--and mean it!"   [emphasis in original]
<P>

<LI> <b>Why have you not acknowledged that your mathematical       
"proof" on pages 152-154 of <i>No Free Lunch</i> that "natural
causes cannot generate CSI" is flawed, since (among other errors) it
claims it applies to all functions <i>f</i>, but actually it
assumes that the function <i>f</i> is known to the intelligent
agent in question?</b>
<BR>

This "proof" is crucial to Dembski's grandiose "Law of Conservation
of Information".   But it's not a proof at all.  As Elsberry
and I showed in
<A HREF="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000102.html">our paper</A>,
the "proof" contains several errors.  Another error is the conflation
of "information" with Dembski's CSI and the blithe assertion that
the pair <i>(i,f)</i> contains at least as much "information" as <i>j</i>,
if <i>f(i) = j</i>.  Dembski has known of these criticisms for nearly
two years, but he has never addressed them.
<P>

<LI> <b>Why have you never seriously addressed the work of artificial life
researchers, who routinely find in their simulations the kinds of novelties
you claim are impossible?</b>
<BR>

Artificial life researchers such as Karl Sims and Thomas Ray carry
out simulations of evolution on computers, using tools such as
mutation, natural selection, and recombination.  They routinely find
the kinds of innovations that Dembski claims are impossible.  Sims,
for example, in his paper "Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition",
published in <i>Artificial Life IV</i>, showed how simple 3-D robots could
evolve very interesting and novel strategies for locomotion and fighting,
even though those strategies were not programmed in by the programmers.
<P>

But Dembski never seriously addresses these findings.  In <i>The
Design Revolution</i>, the index contains an entry for Thomas Ray, but
but when one looks at the indicated page (page 67), there is a discussion
of John Ray, but nothing about Thomas Ray.  Karl Sims is nowhere to be
discussed.
<P>

<LI> <b>Why do you continue to conflate your term "specified complexity" with
Davies' use of the term, when Davies is clearly referring to events with
high Kolmogorov complexity, whereas you are referring to events with
low Kolmogorov complexity?  </b>
<BR>


This is one of Dembski's rhetorical tricks.  He sometimes calls his
main concept "specified complexity" and sometimes calls it
"complex specified information".  He then exploits his own
confusing terminology by conflating his own terms of art with
well-known uses of the terms "complexity" and "information" when it is
useful.
<P>

In particular, Dembski has located other occurrences of the
term "specified complexity" in the literature, and then implies that
his concept is the same as these other uses.   But it is not.
In Davies <i>The Fifth Miracle</i>, for example, he makes it clear
on page 116 that by "complexity" he means <i>high</i>
Kolmogorov complexity (although
he attributes it to Chaitin).  (What precisely Davies means by
"specified" is less clear.)  But for Dembski, specified complexity
corresponds to <i>low</i> Kolmogorov complexity (see, for example,
<i>No Free Lunch</i>, p. 144).  Pretending these are synonyms when in
fact they are antonyms is deceptive.
<P>


</OL>

The bottom line is that <i>The Design Revolution</i> has little that
is new.  Much of the content has been lifted, in some cases word-for-word,
from Dembski's previous work.  His answers to questions are a masterpiece
of evasion and misdirection.  And he refuses to answer the really tough
questions about intelligent design.  The folks who endorsed this
book -- from Rick Santorum to Robert George to David Berlinski -- should
be ashamed of themselves.
