  <p>We all know about William Dembski's many educational degrees -- in part
because he isn't shy about <A HREF="http://www.designinference.com/biosketch.htm">reeling them off</A>.  It's not the usual man who can exhibit two master's degrees and two Ph. D.'s.  Such educational experience suggests a man who is in love with learning and who respects scholarship.  All the more strange, then, that Dembski seems to be so completely incompetent when it comes to quotations.


<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>In my <A HREF="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/nflr3.pdf">review</A> of Dembski's <i>No Free Lunch</i>, I already pointed out how Dembski's use of a line from the movie <i>Contact</i> was misleading.  Not only did he get the quote wrong, he also misstated the name of the character who said it and what the line referred to!  

<p>In that article, I also showed how he quoted selectively from a review of Keith Devlin to make it appear that Devlin was endorsing his work.  


<p>In another article that recently appeared in <i>Reports of the National Center for
Science Education</i>, I showed how Dembski took a claim of Del Ratzsch about
the Smithsonian and dramatically inflated it, to the point where it became
false.  (An earlier version of my article is available <A HREF="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/cw.html">here</A>.)


<p>Now Dembski's latest book, <i>The Design Revolution:  Answering the
Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design</i> shows an even more curious
inability to relate quotations accurately.


<p>Take, for example, page 201.  There Dembski writes


<p><pre>
One of skepticism's patron saints, H. L. Mencken, remarked, "For
every problem, there is a neat, simple solution, and it is always wrong."
</pre>


<p>Wrong again, Dr. Dembski.  It only took me 5 minutes on the Internet, and
a 5-minute trip to the library, to find the original source of the
quotation.  It is Mencken's 1920 book, <i>Prejudices:  Second Series</i>,
and it appears on page 158.  The real quote is:  "Explanations exist; they
have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every
human problem --- neat, plausible, and wrong."  Now if I can do this in ten
minutes, why can't Dembski be bothered?  Is good scholarship so unimportant?


<p>On page 20, Dembski quotes Haldane about the four stages of acceptance
of new ideas, but the first part of the quotation "Theories pass through
four stages of acceptance" doesn't appear in Haldane's actual quote.
Instead, Haldane wrote "I suppose the process of acceptance will pass
through the usual four stages:" (See "The truth about death" in
<i>Journal of Genetics</i> <b>58</b> (1962-3),
pp. 463-464 for the real quote.)


<p>The fact that Haldane uses the term "usual" suggests the four stages
predate him, and in fact similar statements can be found in the writings of the German embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1866) (where it is 
attributed to Agassiz), Zahm (1896) (where it is attributed to
Whewell); and William James (1907).


<p>But it gets even worse.  Also on page 20, Dembski writes


<p><tt>
According to Arthur Schopenhauer, "All truth passes through three
stages.  First, it is ridiculed.  Second, it is violently opposed.  Third,
it is accepted as being self-evident."
</tt>


<p>The only problem is that Schopenhauer apparently never said this.


<p>Several years ago, long before Dembski used this quote,
I spent about three years, off and on, looking for its source. It wasn't easy. I consulted Schopenhauer scholars, examined dozens of quote dictionaries, used many electronic resources, and submitted a query to the British radio program <i>Quote, Unquote</i>. Eventually I determined that in all likelihood, Schopenhauer never said this (although he did say something vaguely analogous in 1818) and that the
erroneous attribution may have originated in a 1981 interview with author Edward
Packard.


<p>When I saw the quote being touted in a preliminary version of Dembski's book in May 2002, I immediately wrote him and informed him that the quote was very probably
specious.  He then replied with a three-word message:  "Prove me wrong."


<p>But quotations are particularly susceptible to misattribution; there
are even two books (Boller and George's <i>They Never Said It</i>, and
Keyes' <i>Nice Guys Finish Seventh</i>) devoted to tracking down the
original source of quotations.   It is, of course, nearly impossible
to prove that someone <i>didn't</i> say something.  And anyone can
invent or misremember a quotation and then find someone to attribute it to.
As Ralph Keyes said, "Any quotation that can be altered will be."
The burden of proof is on the person hawking the quotation,
not the skeptic.


<p>I then referred Dembski to my forthcoming letter to <i>Skeptic</i> magazine
(which was published later that year),
in which I explained why the Schopenhauer quote was 
in all likelihood fabricated.  Since it was so discredited,
I felt sure that Dembski would not use
the quote in the published version of his book.


<p>So I was astonished to open <i>The Design Revolution</i> and discover
that Dembski continues to use the quote, and continues to attribute it to
Schopenhauer. The fact that he does so suggests a certain contempt for accuracy incompatible with being a scholar -- no matter how many degrees he has.  As American humorist Josh Billings (Henry Wheeler Shaw) wrote,
"I honestly beleave it iz better tew know nothing than two know what ain't so."


<p>Oh, and the Mencken quote?  Ironically, it appears in a piece he titled
<i>The Divine Afflatus</i>.  The Oxford English Dictionary gives one
definition of "afflatus"
as "the miraculous communication of supernatural knowledge".  Maybe
ID should be renamed "afflatus theory".  Or even better, "a flatus theory".
