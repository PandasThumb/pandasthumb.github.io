  <p>Whilst reading Stephen C. Meyer’s latest <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000430.html">publication</a>, I had the strangest feeling that I had seen it before somewhere. Well, given that Meyer is an “intelligent design” advocate, the feeling that one is not getting a pure feed of innovative, novel prose is perhaps simply to be expected. It didn’t take long to find the source of a substantial chunk of the “new” paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>S.C. Meyer, M. Ross, P. Nelson, &amp; P. Chien. 2003. The Cambrian explosion: biology’s big bang. Pp. 323–402 in I. A. Campbell &amp; S. C. Meyer, eds., Darwinism, design and public education. Mich­igan State University Press, Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That reference comes right from the citations in Meyer 2004. It is cited in the paper in support of a couple of specific claims. It is not noted as a substantial source of the text of the Meyer 2004 article.</p>

<p>But Meyer et al. 2003 <strong>is</strong> a source of a substantial proportion of the Meyer 2004 text. Read on for the details…</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In physical science the first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s one thing to say that it looks like there are similarities between two texts, and another to produce a measure of how much similarity there is. So I wasn’t satisfied with just noting a few close correspondences. I wanted to find out just how much cutting-and-pasting occurred between the two texts.</p>

<p>Nick Matzke looked around for some plagiarism-detection software solutions, but the stuff available appeared to either lack features or require the payment of cold, hard cash. So I decided to write my own Perl script to do the job.</p>

<p>It has taken a few days of debugging, but I have a version that I am pretty satisfied with now. It will take two file names from the command line and read both in. The first is treated as the text which may be copied in part from the second file. Words of some length <em>i</em> or longer are matched across the two texts. At every point of a match, the script tries to find the longest run of words possible with some <em>m</em> words perhaps deleted or inserted at a time. If the number of words in a run meets or exceeds some number <em>n</em>, the matching text is saved for a report. Since every potential match is examined, false negatives should be absent. (I won’t guarantee that the script never has a false negative; after all, I’m not a perfect coder.) A simple test to see if a potentially matching word is already part of an identified run helps keep down redundant processing.</p>

<p>Now. about false positives… the script certainly does have those. The important thing to do is to characterize the rate at which false positives may appear, such that when one considers the results, one may adjust the findings in light of the false positive rate. How many false positives are seen depends upon the lengths of the texts that are compared and the vocabulary used in the texts.</p>

<p>Having said all that, here are the numbers for various comparisons.</p>

<p>It can readily be seen from the results above that the script finds that over a third of Meyer 2004 has been lifted from Meyer et al. 2003. The tightening-up of results given the longer n&gt;=10 run length indicates that the true proportion is over 33%.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of matches found between Meyer 2004 and Meyer et al. 2003:</p>

http://www.antievolution.org/people/meyer_sc/meyer2004_bio_info/mnr_bbb_comp.html)</p>

<p>As a check, I also ran the Perl Algorithm::Diff package’s “traverse_sequences” routine, and found the following result for comparing Meyer 2004 to Meyer et al. 2003:</p>

<p>5,484 words out of 13,534 match, 40.5 %</p>

<p>As yet another check of my script’s sensitivity, I compared two review articles on the same subject by the same first author published three years apart. In looking for runs of 10 words or more, there were two matches comprising some 28 words, or 1% of the total length of the more recent paper. (Nonaka, Masaru, and Yoshizaki, Fumiko. 2004. <em>Evolution of the complement system</em>. Molecular Immunology Volume 40, Issue 12, February 2004, Pages 897-902 compared to Nonaka, Masaru. 2001. <em>Evolution of the complement system</em>. Current Opinion in Immunology Volume 13, Issue 1, 1 February, Pages 69-73.)</p>

<p>As a philosopher of science, Meyer should know a thing or two about scientific custom when it comes to journal articles. One custom is that <em>one does not submit for publication in a peer-reviewed publication work that has already been substantially published in another peer-reviewed publication</em>. Now, I don’t think that this applies in this case, but Stephen Meyer <em>ought to</em>. After all, the Discovery Institute bills the book that Meyer et al. 2003 appears in as “peer reviewed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SEATTLE  Darwinism, Design and Public Education (DDPE) is a peer-reviewed book published by Michigan State University Press that presents a multi-faceted scientific case for the theory of intelligent design while also examining the legal and pedagogical arguments for teaching students about the scientific controversies that surround the issue of biological origins. Contributors to the book include both leading scientific proponents of intelligent design and neo-Darwinism.</p>

<p>ID fans are fond of saying that you don’t get any more information in two copies of a newspaper than in one. This is of course false, as <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/people/wre/papers/eandsdembski.pdf">Elsberry and Shallit 2003</a> note. But the germ of truth in it is that you don’t get any more <em>misinformation</em> in two ID papers than in one: it’s the same old same old.</p>
