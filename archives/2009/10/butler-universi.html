  <p>According to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/10/16/butler">Inside Higher Education</a>, Butler University has sued one of its own undergraduates, junior Jess Zimmerman, for defamation. The incident was also picked up by Stu Kreisman at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stu-kreisman/student-blogger-shut-down_b_325370.html">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Details are murky, at least to me, but evidently the university had demoted both Mr. Zimmerman’s father, Michael Zimmerman, founder of <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/evolution-weeke-1.html">Evolution Weekend</a>, and his stepmother, Andrea Gullickson, the chairman of the school of music. When Professor Gullickson was demoted, Jess Zimmerman anonymously wrote a blog in which he accused the university of acting arbitrarily.  <a href="http://www.akadoe.blogspot.com/">The suit was dropped</a> yesterday, but there is no guarantee that the university will not reinstate it.</p>

<p>Mr. Zimmerman’s blog pages are archived <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/10/16/butler">here</a>. I have read them through, perhaps not with the precision of a lawyer determined to make a case where there is none, and I have found nothing that could reasonably be considered  threatening or defamatory, unless you consider in that category the implication that the dean is thin-skinned and  needs to surround himself with yes-men and -women. I admit it is at least a bit tacky to publish such a blog anonymously, when you yourself have a personal interest in the case, but the anonymity as such did not seem to be the university’s main concern.</p>

<p>Michael Zimmerman is evidently negotiating with the university over his demotion. <em>Inside Higher Education</em> reports that the university suggested that it would settle with Michael Zimmerman, provided that Jess Zimmerman submitted to university disciplinary action  and agreed not to appeal. It further asked for a gag order on both Zimmermans. I am not of a particularly suspicious nature, but it is completely unclear to me how Jess Zimmerman’s case is related to Michael Zimmerman’s case.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that this suit is anything more than a SLAPP suit, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation">strategic suit against public participation</a>.  These are lawsuits designed to intimidate political and other opponents and keep them silent with the threat of significant legal fees.  If I remember correctly, they were pioneered by rich old men facing recall elections.  Indiana, where Butler University is located, is one of several states that has enacted anti-SLAPP suit legislation. Typically, if the defendant  successfully files an anti-SLAPP motion, then the plaintiff is responsible for the defendant’s attorney’s fees.</p>
