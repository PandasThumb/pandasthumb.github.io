  <p><strong>By Joe Felsenstein, <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/felsenstein.htm">http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/felsenstein.htm</a></strong></p>

<p>In <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/a-peer-reviewed.html">
a previous thread</a> here, and in other blogs, there
have been many people arguing that William Dembski and
Robert Marks’s recent “pro-ID” paper isn’t
really pro-ID, that it is equally compatible with
theistic evolution or even nontheistic evolution.
William Dembski has now
<a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/evolutionary-informatics-as-intelligent-design-and-not-as-theistic-evolution/">
replied</a> at his Uncommon Descent blog to these comments.</p>

<p>He argues that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key contention of ID is that design in nature, and in biology in
particular, is detectable. Evolutionary informatics, by looking at the
information requirements of evolutionary processes, points to information
sources beyond evolution and thus, indirectly, to a designer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theistic evolution, by contrast, accepts the Darwinian view that Darwinian
processes generate the information required for biological complexity
internally, without any outside source of information. The results by Marks and
me are showing that this cannot be the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dembski and Marks’s argument is (in effect) that smoothness of the
adaptive landscape means that information has been built into the
situation, and that natural selection
does not create new information, but instead transfers this existing
information into the genome.
To Dembski, the Designer acts by creating this information.</p>

<p>There is no requirement that this creation of information
happen multiple times.  A
Designer (or just the laws of physics) could set up the world so that 
it is one in which adaptive surfaces are smooth enough that natural selection 
succeeds in bringing about adaptation.  That setting-up could have happened 
back before the first living organisms existed.</p>

<p>Should other supporters of ID be happy with such a
picture?  It certainly does not argue for the fixity of species,
or against large-scale evolutionary change.  But I suspect that many theistic
evolutionists would
find it consistent with their views.</p>

<p>Evolutionary biologists may
prefer a different definition.  Intelligent Design only differs
from existing theories on evolution if it involves a Designer who
intervenes at least once after the origin of life.  If ID
advocates want to argue that there is something wrong with
evolutionary biology, they should put forward a theory that
makes some different prediction about what happens during evolution
after that origin.</p>

<p>Dembski draws the distinction as involving where the information
comes from.  Evolutionary biologists will probably prefer to
focus on whether there is evidence for interventions by a Designer.</p>
