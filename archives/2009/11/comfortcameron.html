  <p>For some reason or other I got on the email list of Ray Comfort’s mailing list.  What can I say, I am a connoisseur of the weird.  As I’ve learned a little bit about Comfort’s ministry, I have been beginning to wonder – is this whole “Darwin giveaway” thing actually going to happen?  Or is it mostly imaginary – primarily a fundraising stunt?  I have seen lots of evidence that Comfort et al. are good at publicity and producing videos – but no evidence that they are strong on the ground.  If they were actually organized to distribute hundreds of thousands of books on hundreds of campuses, I kind of think there would be more evidence of that organization.  But there is virtually no such evidence, despite there being plenty of fundamentalist student groups on campuses that might serve as the foot soldiers for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Here’s the latest odd thing along these lines –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PRESS RELEASE - 5 of 7 - Militant Atheists Seek Details</strong></p>

  <p>Militant Atheists Seek Details of Darwin Book Giveaway</p>

  <p>When 170,000 copies of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species with Ray Comfort’s Introduction are given away at universities around the country, atheists plan to be waiting for them. But they don’t know the identity of the universities the books will be given out. Comfort said. “The reason atheists are finding nothing is because every school that is being visited is a closely guarded secret. We don’t want to cause a disturbance. We simply want to get books into the hands of students across the country.” Others advised those who see the books being handed out said, “Cut out the intro in front of them, leave it on the table and take the book.” Another said, “Get them to sign [the] book, thank them, and then make some devastating point that will shatter them forever.” See http://www.livingwaters.com/origin “Press kit” for textual, audio, and video sound bites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  The list of schools being visited is a closely-guarded secret?  Then why what it on their website at one point (if I recall correctly – <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_comfort_replies_to_eugenie.php#comment-2043608">here’s a copy from September</a>), and <a href="http://www.wikio.com/video/1693389">why did they proudly announce in the original video</a> that the top 50 American universities would be targeted?  In that video, they also said they were working with Campus Crusade, Answers in Genesis, and the Alliance Defense Fund – but I haven’t heard anything about the Origin-into-schools project from those groups.</p>

<p>Anyway, it doesn’t make much sense and I don’t have any firsthand information, but at the moment I’m wondering if this Origin-into-schools thing will poke above the background noise of random crazies who hand out stuff on the quads of college campuses every day. (You can be sure, though, that there will be one place with Ray Comfort and his camera crew, since in some arenas, a video is worth more than 1,000,000 words and 1,000 on-the-ground volunteers.)</p>
