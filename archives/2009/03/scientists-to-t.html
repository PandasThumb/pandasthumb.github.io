  <p>Below is a letter from over 50 scientific societies urging the Texas Board of Education to promote the modern science education curriculum developed by its own committees of educational and scientific experts.  Right now the board is considering replacing the curriculum developed by its experts with one developed by anti-science culture warriors.  The quack in charge of the process recently <a href="http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/03/25/0325mcleroy_edit.html">advocated lying to Texas students</a> about evolution and has <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/03/mcelroy_endorses_idiotic_anti-.php">endorsed a book</a> that “calls Christians who accept evolution ‘morons’ and parents that teach their children evolution ‘monsters.’”</p>

<p>As Texas is one of the two largest textbook markets, any decision they make to promote quackery is likely to adversely affect other states and the capacity of our nation to be scientifically competitive in the future.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>A Message to the Texas State Board of Education</strong></p>

<p>The undersigned scientific and educational societies call on the Texas State Board of Education to support accurate science education for all students by adopting the science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills or TEKS) as recommended to you by the scientists and educators on your writing committees.</p>

<p>Evolution is the foundation of modern biology, and is also crucial in fields as diverse as agriculture, computer science, engineering, geology, and medicine. We oppose any efforts to undermine the teaching of biological evolution and related topics in the earth and space sciences, whether by misrepresenting those subjects, or by inaccurately and misleadingly describing them as controversial and in need of special scrutiny.</p>

<p>At its January 2009 meeting, the Texas Board of Education rightly rejected attempts to add language to the TEKS about “strengths and weaknesses” – used in past efforts to undermine the teaching of evolution in Texas. We urge the Board to stand firm in rejecting any such attempts to compromise the teaching of evolution.</p>

<p>At its January 2009 meeting, the Board also adopted a series of amendments to the TEKS that misrepresent biological evolution and related topics in the earth and space sciences. We urge the Board to heed the advice of the scientific community and the experienced scientists and educators who drafted the TEKS: reject these and any other amendments which single out evolution for scrutiny beyond that applied to other scientific theories.</p>

<p>By adopting the TEKS crafted by your expert writing committees, the Board will serve the best educational interests of students in Texas’s public schools.</p>
