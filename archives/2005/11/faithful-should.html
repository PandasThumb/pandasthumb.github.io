  <p>More news from the Vatican</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Vatican cardinal said Thursday the faithful should listen to what secular modern science has to offer, warning that religion risks turning into “fundamentalism” if it ignores scientific reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051104/ap_on_sc/vatican_science">Vatican: Faithful Should Listen to Science</a></p>

<p>Not surprisingly the questions asked, involved the issue of evolution and Intelligent Design</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Poupard and others at the news conference were asked about the religion-science debate raging in the United States over evolution and “intelligent design.”</p>

  <p>Intelligent design’s supporters argue that natural selection, an element of evolutionary theory, cannot fully explain the origin of life or the emergence of highly complex life forms.</p>

  <p>Monsignor Gianfranco Basti, director of the Vatican project STOQ, or Science, Theology and Ontological Quest, reaffirmed John Paul’s 1996 statement that evolution was “more than just a hypothesis.”</p>

  <p>“A hypothesis asks whether something is true or false,” he said. “(Evolution) is more than a hypothesis because there is proof.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the comments by the Pope are in fact Catholic doctrine while the statements by Schoenborn, other than being perhaps confused by DI rethoric, were just that “his own comments”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was asked about comments made in July by Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, who dismissed in a New York Times article the 1996 statement by John Paul as “rather vague and unimportant” and seemed to back intelligent design.</p>

  <p>Basti concurred that John Paul’s 1996 letter “is not a very clear expression from a definition point of view,” but he said evolution was assuming ever more authority as scientific proof develops.</p>

  <p>Poupard, for his part, stressed that what was important was that “the universe wasn’t made by itself, but has a creator.” But he added, “It’s important for the faithful to know how science views things to understand better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And since ID is scientifically vacuous and theologically risky, it should not come as a surprise that it has not much to contribute to these issues. Other than to add to the confusion of the faithful.</p>
