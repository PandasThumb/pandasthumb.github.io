  <p>In the <strong>I am not making this stuff up category</strong>, the ID crowd is planning on sending a battalion of pseudoscientists to Kansas this May for the upcoming ID Kangaroo Court.  On the front page of the <a href="http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/sci_standards.htm">Intelligent Design Network</a>’s “we’re not promoting ID” <a href="http://www.kansasscience2005.com/">website</a>, we find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PUBLIC HEARINGS ON MINORITY REPORT.  A Committee of the State board has scheduled hearings to provide for an in-depth examination of the Minority Report and its proposed changes. The hearings will be conducted in Topeka on May 5, 6 and 7, and May 12, 13 and 14 at a place to be announced.   <a href="http://www.kansasscience2005.com/Witness%20list%20delivered%20to%20Committee%204-5-04%20wopi.pdf">CLICK HERE FOR A LIST OF WITNESSES TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY FOR THE MINORITY REPORT</a></p>

<p>That’s right, the creationists on the Kansas State Board of Education are planning to use Kansas taxpayer funds in order to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fly in these folks from all over the world – a collection of scientists outside their fields, non-scientists, and straight-up cranks.</li>
  <li>Put on a pointless show trial which will be boycotted by most/all real experts on evolution</li>
  <li>In order to provide political cover for the decision to use the power of the state to change the definition of science in Kansas</li>
  <li>Actively misinforming Kansas’s bright young students and promoting “intelligent design”, which Charles Thaxton himself used to call “creationism” before he began promoting “intelligent design”</li>
  <li>Provoking another round of international scorn and ridicule for the poor citizens of Kansas, and</li>
  <li>Violating the U.S. Constitution as soon as a public school teacher attempts to teach ID as science</li>
  <li>Provoking another round of international scorn, plus a nice expensive lawsuit</li>
  <li>Which the state will eventually lose.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sounds like a good plan to me.</p>
