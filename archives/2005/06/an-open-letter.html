  <p>In her ‘response’ to<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">Orr’s excellent contribution</a> in the New Yorker, Denyse O’Leary <a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2005_05_25_post-darwinist_archive.html">quotes Luskin</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Luskin, an apparent enfant terrible, also challenges Orr on a sensitive point:</p>

  <p>I publicly invite Allen Orr to explain to us how his Darwinian view of life interfaces with his personal religious beliefs. Public disclosure of Orr’s personal views would go much further towards reassuring people that it is possible to believe in God and evolution than would his mere citation to a statement by a pope who said that God and evolution are compatible. My e-mail address is casey@ideacenter.org.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any other Darwinist is welcome to do the same, I suppose.</p>

<p>Seems that O’Leary  nor Luskin may not be too familiar with evolutionary theory or religious faith or they would have been familiar with the over 4000 people who signed the <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm">following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.</p>

  <p>We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as “one theory among others” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God’s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God’s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, the NCSE has a list of <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4650_statements_from_religious_orga_3_13_2001.asp">Religios organizations</a>  on evolution and faith.</p>

<p>Until ID’ers stop confusing science and philosophical naturalism, I doubt that they will ever understand science or religious faith.</p>

<p>So far ‘post darwinism’ seems to be nothing more than the argument from ignorance, so typical of Intelligent Design.</p>
