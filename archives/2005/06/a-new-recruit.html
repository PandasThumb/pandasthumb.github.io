  <p>The Discovery Institute is doing a fine job of raising the visibility of creationism and focusing the attention of their enemies. They say things like <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/index.php?title=new_york_times_should_screen_privileged&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Although much of the public controversy over intelligent design has focused on the application of design to biology, it’s important to remember that design theory itself reaches well beyond biology, and that some of the strongest evidence for design comes from such fields as physics, astronomy, and cosmology.</p></blockquote>

<p>And suddenly, scientists in disciplines other than biology perk up and realize that these clowns are coming to pester them next. <i>The Privileged Planet</i> debacle is a sign that the anti-evolutionists are eager to pollute national science institutions and all scientific disciplines with their garbage, and more and more scientists are going to be speaking out harshly against them. The <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001136.html">utter vacuity</a> of the creationist responses in Kansas is also a sign of their weakness; the DI has overreached itself, and blood is in the water.</p>

<p>The newest recruit is <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/?p=67">Phil Plait of the Bad Astronomy Blog</a>. Phil has always been ready to dismantle the  abuse of his discipline by the media, but now he's alerted to the <em>bad</em> physics, astronomy, and cosmology of the Discovery Institute, and plans to spend more effort fighting the distortions of the creationists.</p>

<blockquote><p>Young Earth creationists have let slip the dogmas of war. In the ensuing battles they will use a host of weapons, including misrepresenting facts, mining of quotes, belaboring outdated theories, and dancing around to avoid answering direct questions. Mark my words: <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html" target="_blank">their history is clear</a>.</p>
<p>They may have fired the first shot, but we have plenty of ammo on our side as well. And we also have many, <i>many</i> scientists willing to accept this call to arms.</p>
<p>I’m one of them. Over the course of time, you’ll be seeing more rebuttals — no, <i>debunking</i> — of creationist claims here. I’ve had enough, and this threat is real. They want to turn our classrooms in a theocratically-controlled anti-science breeding ground, and I’m not going to sit by and watch it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every anti-science, anti-education bill in a legislature makes a state full of bitter foes, every national embarrassment creates a horde of angry scientists. I think the only thing we've lost in our war with the creationists so far is our complacency.</p>
