  <p>A couple of weeks ago, after I posted on Panda’s Thumb a brief response (see <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Reply_toDemb_reply.cfm">here</a>)  to Dembski’s amusing dismissal of my essay published in Skeptic, v. 11, No 4, 2005 (without his saying a word about the   substance of my critique), on the website maintained by Dembski appeared a comment whose author accused me of false claims regarding my publication record.</p>

<p>As I had mentioned before, the last time I updated my list of publication was in 1985, when I applied for a position at CSUF. At that time the list already contained over 200 items, even though it did not include many of my published papers which were outside my professional work (many such papers were published in several languages in magazines such as <em>Partisan Review, Midstream, Present Tense, Kontinent, Possev, Ukrainian Quarterly, Samtiden, Vremya Iskat [Et Levakesh], Vremia I My</em>, and others).</p>

<p>Confronted with the libelous post on Dembski’s site, which Dembski chose to keep without rebuttals, thus in fact joining the author of the calumny, I searched my files and found my List of publications which I submitted to CSUF in 1985. It contained 211 items, even omitting many publications outside my professional research.</p>

<p>Dr. Wesley R. Elsberry kindly offered to scan and OCR the text of that list of publications (many thanks, Wesley).  Thanks to Wesley’s generous assistance, this list, <em>which is more than 20 years old</em>, although containing a few OCR errors, can now be seen <a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/List.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need to prove that I did not abruptly stop publishing in 1984.  Were the list updated after 1985, its size would grow by more publications, and more so if, besides my research papers, it included also papers dealing with pseudo-science in its various disguises. If my papers and the book which are not about my research in physics were added, the total would be now <em>over</em> 300 items, in tune with what I claimed in my response to Dembski’s post.</p>

<p>I apologize for taking space on Panda’s Thumbs by posting these remarks, but I feel it is proper to post them after the libelous comment appeared on Dembski’s site, where, as it is known, no comments are allowed which are short of either praising Dembski or attacking his critics.</p>
