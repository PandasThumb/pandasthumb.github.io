  <p>Well, <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/society/1720/section/creation.scientistchallenges.intelligent.design/1.htm">this “news” article</a> is hilarious in an uncountable number of ways:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/society/1720/section/creation.scientistchallenges.intelligent.design/1.htm">Creation Scientist Challenges Intelligent Design</a></p>

  <p>Saturday, Aug. 6, 2005 Posted: 9:12:30AM EST</p>

  <p>One of the world’s leading experts in origin of life research issued a statement on Friday saying that intelligent design should not be taught in schools because it is not science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(more below the fold)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.reasons.org/">Dr. Fazale Rana</a>, vice president for science apologetics of the organization <a href="http://www.reasons.org/">Reasons to Believe</a>, said in his statement, “As currently formulated, Intelligent Design is not science. It is not falsifiable and makes no predictions about future scientific discoveries.”</p>

  <p>Dr. Rana further commented on the idea of teaching intelligent design in schools.</p>

  <p>“As a biochemist, I am opposed to introducing any idea into the educational process that is scientifically ludicrous,” said Dr. Rana. “Proponents of Intelligent Design lose credibility, for instance, when they say that the Earth is thousands of years old when the scientific evidence and the fossil record clearly prove our Earth is at least 4.5 billion years.”</p>

  <p>Intelligent design, the idea that the earth is so complex, there must have been a divine being behind its creation, is the most recent challenge to the theory of evolution. In the past year, several school districts have considered whether or not to incorporate the teaching of intelligent design in public schools. Some state legislatures are deciding on bills that would require science teachers to teach intelligent design alongside evolution.</p>

  <p>The debate is a familiar one, an offshoot of the creation-evolution debate, and one that has generated conversation across international circles. Probably the most publicized debate was held in May, when the Kansas State Board of Education called together witnesses from around the world to testify about intelligent design. The state board is currently deciding whether to adopt new science standards to allow the teaching of intelligent design and other alternative theories on the origin of life in schools. Scientists boycotted the hearings.</p>

  <p>Dr. Rana’s position gives him a unique perspective on the issue. As a scientist and a Christian, Dr. Rana provides a point of view that is often overlooked in the debate. As a leader of Reasons to Believe, Dr. Rana works to bridge the gap between science and faith, especially on issues such as the origin of life.</p>

  <p>“At Reasons to Believe, our team of scientists has developed a theory for creation that embraces the latest scientific advances. It is fully testable, falsifiable, and successfully predicts the current discoveries in origin of life research,” said Dr. Rana.</p>

  <p>“With the creation model approach every perspective is encouraged to participate in the scientific process to see which theory best fits the emerging data,” continued Dr. Rana. “With this cutting edge program no philosophical or religious perspective is denied access.”</p>

  <p>“It holds the possibility of bringing to resolution the creation/evolution controversy once and for all.”</p>
