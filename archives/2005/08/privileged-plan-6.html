  <p>Guillermo Gonzalez, author of “Privileged Planet” is touting the concept of Intelligent, reports “<a href="http://www.theiowachannel.com/education/4897993/detail.html">The Iowa Channel”</a>. It is creating quite some uproar at Iowa State University.</p>

<p>Gonzalez wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s something that brings a renewed interest in science”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gonzalez remains silent as to how this brings a renewed interest in science. Conflating science and religion never serves a good purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gonzalez said that humans are the product of a creator – whether it is God or whomever – and were not created by chance and a product of evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michael Clough, an assistant professor at ISU who prepares future science teachers for the classroom, said intelligent design is simply not science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good for science and education, 120 staff and faculty at ISU have signed a petition asking that the university reject all attempts to represent intelligent design as a scientific endeavor.</p>

<p>More of Gonzalez’s creationist ‘publications’ can be found at the <a href="http://www.reasons.org">Reasons to Believe</a> website, whose mission statement includes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mission of Reasons To Believe is to show that science and faith are, and always will be, allies, not enemies. Our mission is to bring that life-changing truth to as many people as possible, both believers and unbelievers.</p>

  <p>It is our conviction that since the same God who “authored” the universe also inspired the writings of the Bible, a consistent message will come through both channels. In other words, the facts of nature will never contradict the words of the Bible when both are properly interpreted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dmregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050826/NEWS02/508260394/1001">Desmoines Register</a> reports that Gonzalez does not approve of the actions of his colleages</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guillermo Gonzalez , an ISU astronomy professor who is nationally known for his research on intelligent design, said his colleagues are creating a hostile work climate by circulating the petition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enjoy the many arguments against the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/privileged_planet/index.html">Privileged Planet thesis</a></p>

<p>Funny how ID proponents start complaining about ‘hostile environments’ when scientists stand up to point out the flaws in ID’s claims.</p>

<p>The full petition reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>We, the undersigned faculty members at Iowa State, reject all attempts to represent Intelligent Design as a scientific endeavor.
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Advocates of Intelligent Design claim the position of our planet and the complexity of particular life forms and processes are such that they may only be explained by the existence of a creator or designer of the universe.</p>

  <p>Such claims, however, are premised on 1) the arbitrary selection of features claimed to be engineered by a designer; 2) unverifiable conclusions about the wishes and desires of that designer; and 3) an abandonment by science of methodological naturalism.</p>

  <p>Methodological naturalism, the view that natural phenomena can be explained without reference to supernatural beings or events, is the foundation of the natural sciences. The history of science contains many instances where complex natural phenomena were eventually understood only by adherence to methodological naturalism.</p>

  <p>Whether one believes in a creator or not, views regarding a supernatural creator are, by their very nature, claims of religious faith, and not within the scope or abilities of science. We, therefore, urge all faculty members to uphold the integrity of our university of science and technology, and convey to students and the general public the importance of methodological naturalism in science and reject efforts to portray Intelligent Design as science.</p>
