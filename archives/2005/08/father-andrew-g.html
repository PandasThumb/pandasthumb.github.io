  <p>Father <a href="http://www.agreeley.com/">Andrew Greeley</a> who is described as:</p>

<p>Father Greeley wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most influential Catholic thinkers and writers of our time, priest, sociologist, author and journalist Father Andrew M. Greeley has built an international assemblage of devout fans over a career that spans five decades. He is the author of over 50 best-selling novels and more than 100 works of non-fiction and his writing has been translated into 12 languages. A Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona and a Research Associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, Father Greeley is a respected scholar whose current research focuses on the Sociology of Religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>has written a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/greeley/22greeley.html">powerful article on the Schoenborn comments</a>.</p>

<p>Father Greeley wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cardinal has muddied the waters of the discourse between science and religion. Religion, he seems to be saying, much to the delight of the Evangelicals, can dictate scientific conclusions – such as it once dictated that the sun revolved around the Earth on the basis of a couple of verses in the book of Exodus.</p>

  <p>The cardinal’s assertion will upset most Catholic scientists and confuse many of the educated laity (something that the present pope has always deplored). Moreover, it provides the New York Times another chance to pursue its anti-Catholic bias. The cardinal has “redefined” the issue. Now a political alliance between Catholics and Evangelicals will be easier to achieve. A cardinal can’t do that. Only the pope and/or a Gen eral Council (acting in union with the pope) defines anything. The traditional bias against Catholics among conservative Christians (which my research shows still exists) makes such a political coalition most unlikely.</p>

  <p>At night, the sound of the waves pounding against the beach lulls me to sleep. Although I know the physics and the meterology behind that sound, the beauty of the surf on the beach assures me that there is Beauty in the universe of which that sound is a reflection. Love too. Good night, lake. Good night, God.</p>
