  <p>Chris Mooney, who has written before on the “he said, she said” style of much science journalism (see <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/PDF/IDandtheMedia.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>), and Matthew Nisbet have the cover story in the current <a href="http://www.cjr.org/issues/2005/5/mooney.asp">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, writing on the (mis)reporting of evolution in the mainstream press.  Referring to a <em>Washington Post</em> story about the battles over teaching intelligent design in public schools, Mooney and Nisbet wrote</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet Slevin’s article conspicuously failed to provide any background information on the theory of evolution, or why it’s considered a bedrock of modern scientific knowledge among both scientists who believe in God and those who don’t. Indeed, the few defenders of evolution quoted by Slevin were attached to advocacy groups, not research universities; most of the article’s focus, meanwhile, was on anti-evolutionists and their strategies. Of the piece’s thirty-eight paragraphs, twenty-one were devoted to this “strategy” framing — an emphasis that, not surprisingly, rankled the Post’s science reporters. “How is it that The Washington Post can run a feature-length A1 story about the battle over the facts of evolution and not devote a single paragraph to what the evidence is for the scientific view of evolution?” protested an internal memo from the paper’s science desk that was copied to Michael Getler, the Post’s ombudsman. “We do our readers a grave disservice by not telling them. By turning this into a story of dueling talking heads, we add credence to the idea that this is simply a battle of beliefs.” Though he called Slevin’s piece “lengthy, smart, and very revealing,” Getler assigned Slevin a grade of “incomplete” for his work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mooney and Nisbet go on</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As evolution, driven by such events, shifts out of scientific realms and into political and legal ones, it ceases to be covered by context-oriented science reporters and is instead bounced to political pages, opinion pages, and television news. And all these venues, in their various ways, tend to deemphasize the strong scientific case in favor of evolution and instead lend credence to the notion that a growing “controversy” exists over evolutionary science. This notion may be politically convenient, but it is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what is a good editor to do about the very real collision between a scientific consensus and a pseudo-scientific movement that opposes the basis of that consensus? At the very least, newspaper editors should think twice about assigning reporters who are fresh to the evolution issue and allowing them to default to the typical strategy frame, carefully balancing “both sides” of the issue in order to file a story on time and get around sorting through the legitimacy of the competing claims. As journalism programs across the country systematically review their curriculums and training methods, the evolution “controversy” provides strong evidence in support of the contention that specialization in journalism education can benefit not only public understanding, but also the integrity of the media. For example, at Ohio State, beyond basic skill training in reporting and editing, students focusing on public-affairs journalism are required to take an introductory course in scientific reasoning. Students can then specialize further by taking advanced courses covering the relationships between science, the media, and society. They are also encouraged to minor in a science-related field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I am required to report (on the “fair and balanced” principle) that Ohio State is also the university whose <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001127.html"><strong>graduate school requirements were bent to the breaking point</strong></a> by several creationist faculty members.</p>

<p>Mooney and Nisbet review mainstream media coverage of the Kansas Kangaroo hearings in May and the Cobb County stickers trial, and the Dover, PA, coverage, and make some predictions about the nature of the coverage of the upcoming Dover trial.  I commend the piece to all journalists and to scientists fighting the good fight.</p>
