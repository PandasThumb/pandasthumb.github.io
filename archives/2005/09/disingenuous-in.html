  <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer ran two amusing pieces relating to the Kitzmiller case today.  They were amusing in wryly different ways.</p>

<p>In the first article, “All sides of the issue belong in classroom,” Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute argued with a straight face that intelligent-design creationism is not a political issue but rather a scientific issue.  Since the Discovery Institute has done its damnedest to make political hay of ID creationism, Mr. Luskin’s argument is disingenuous at best  (http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/12759702.htm ).</p>

<p>(Mr. Luskin’s claim that ID creationists have published three papers in the last year would also be risible if it weren’t pathetic: None of the papers received an iota of support from any mainstream scientists, one was debunked here on PT (/archives/2004/10/theory-is-as-th.html ), and a second was repudiated by its journal following a scandal involving the outgoing editor.)</p>

<p>In a second article, “ID proponents like designer-less market,” John Allen Paulos (author, most famously, of <em>Innumeracy</em>) asks why “some of the most ardent opponents of Darwinian evolution … are among the most ardent supporters of the free market.”  In short, why do they believe in social Darwinism but not evolutionary biology, even though “biology is a much more substantive science than economics”?  Paulos does not answer, but concludes (http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/12759703.htm ),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would you think of someone who studied economic entities and their interactions in a modern free-market economy and insisted that they were, despite a perfectly reasonable and empirically supported Smithian account of their development, the consequence of some all-powerful, detail-obsessed economic lawgiver? You might deem such a person a conspiracy theorist.</p>

  <p>And what would you think of someone who studied biological processes and organisms and insisted that they were, despite a perfectly reasonable and empirically supported Darwinian account of their development, the consequence of some all-powerful, detail-obsessed biological lawgiver?</p>
