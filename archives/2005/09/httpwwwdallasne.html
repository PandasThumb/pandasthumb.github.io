  <p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/091005dnrelparody.c1a6e20.html">
JEFFREY WEISS</a> of the Dallas Morning News conducted two interviews, one with Dr. Harris</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking for the teaching of intelligent design is William Harris, a professor at the University of Missouri medical school in Kansas City. He’s a researcher in nutritional biochemistry, a Methodist and managing director of the Intelligent Design Network, an online information site supporting intelligent design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and one with Dr. Miller:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the other corner is Kenneth Miller, a cell biologist at Brown University, Catholic and the author of Finding Darwin’s God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found the answers by Dr Harris quite interesting. First he responds with the standard ID response, with a slight but devastating deviation, namely that ID does not demand <em>any particular godhead</em> to be credited.</p>

<p>Q: <em>Dr. Harris, for all the claims your side makes about intelligent design being science, isn’t it also religion?</em></p>

<p>Harris wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s consistent with a theistic explanation but does not demand that any particular godhead be credited with that activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unwittingly perhaps, he has opened up the flood gates by deviating from the script and limiting the intelligent designer to be outside nature.</p>

<p>Q: <em>But you’re talking about an entity who stands outside the limits of time and space with the power to affect the physical world. Isn’t that a god by most definitions?</em></p>

<p>Harris wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. Is that impossible?
Science should be seeking the truth about the natural world regardless of the implications. Why do the implications [that God may be responsible for creation] stop something from being scientifically valid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, ID is not about any specific God but it is surely about one or more Godheads.</p>

<p>Why can’t more ID proponents be more clear about this? Harris then continues with a response which I find quite hilarious as it undermines fully any ID approach as proposed by Dembski or Behe for instance.</p>

<p>Q: <em>But how would a public school teacher legally present that point of view in science class? Even if the teacher didn’t specify who did the designing, wouldn’t students ask?</em></p>

<p>Harris wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why can’t teachers say, “We don’t know,” and leave it at that? Why is that such an awful outcome?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting because instead of ‘we don’t know’ ID proponents typically draw a conclusion of ‘thus designed’ when science fails to provide sufficient detailed explanations.</p>

<p>ID proponents may want to explain why indeed can they not accept “we don’t know” as an answer?</p>

<p>Dr Miller has a far more balanced approach to science and religion.</p>

<p>Miller wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can science approach such an issue? It cannot. By definition, the work of such a god, designer, or creator exists outside the natural world. That’s reason No. 1 why ID is not science and cannot ever be part of science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q: <em>But doesn’t that say science can never explain physical reality, if reality includes ID? Isn’t that a serious flaw in science?</em></p>

<p>Miller wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a Christian, I believe that God is active in my life and yours, and that God’s purpose for our lives is evident in the world around us. However, I never pretend that this theological understanding of nature is scientific. That’s where I part company with the ID crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
