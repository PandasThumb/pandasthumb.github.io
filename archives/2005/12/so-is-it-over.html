  <p>One question I received from a reporter yesterday asked, essentially, if the fight against intelligent design is over with yesterday’s decision. MSNBC has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10548320/">an article along a similar theme</a> today, and those interviewed in the article say the same thing I did: it ain’t over by a long shot. (PZ has some similar <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/back_to_reality_the_morning_after_the_kitzmiller_decision/">sobering thoughts</a> on the topic). While I do think the decision handed down yesterday will make it more difficult for anyone contemplating introducing ID into the classroom, as suggested in the MSNBC article, all that means is that the focus will have to shift a bit. I suspect we’ll see more of “teach the controversy” and less push to teach intelligent design–something the Discovery Institute has already moved to, anyway.</p>

<p>Additionally, while ID has been the major thorn in the side of pro-science groups, it’s obviously not the only bad science out there: just the best-funded. <a href="/archives/2005/12/how-would-you-s.html">As discussed a few days ago,</a> we still have huge challenges to deal with regarding science education in this country–and ID is but one facet of that. We still have groups that regularly spew misinformation about HIV/AIDS, vaccination, global warming, etc.–and certainly, the evolution deniers won’t be going away. Answers in Genesis <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/">is working on their “creation museum”,</a> the Discovery Institute is still <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/">crying about the decision</a>, and certainly ID proponents around the country are going to regroup and work on a revised strategy. This isn’t something that’s going to go away, and it’s not time to rest on our laurels.</p>

<p>My central passion is working on teaching good science, and getting both students and the general public interested in and educated about scientific topics–and that won’t change just because we’ve achieved a major victory against one faction of the anti-science movement. Thus, while I whole-heartedly salute and appreciate the efforts of all of those involved with this trial, the fact remains that we still have much more work to do. I hope many of you who’ve become interested in these issues during the Dover trial will stick with us as we deal with future challenges as well.</p>
