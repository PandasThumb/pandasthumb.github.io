  <P>Disputes and controversies in science are always a good thing.
They're fun to read about (and to write about), and they're
bellwethers of the health of the enterprise. Moreover, they tend to
stimulate thought and experimentation. Whether scientists are
<A HREF="http://cichlid.umd.edu/cichlidlabs/kc/cev/Pennisi2008.pdf">bickering
about evo-devo</A>, or about <A HREF="http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/072710/page4">stem
cells in cancer</A>, or about <A HREF="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/05/13/in-the-prebiotic-kitchen/">prebiotic
chemistry</A>, and whether or not the climate is genial or hostile,
the result is valuable.</P>
<P>Now of course, some controversies are invented by demagogues for
political purposes. The dispute in such cases is far less interesting
and clearly less profitable, even if participation by scientists is
necessary.</P>
<P>This week, two papers in <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html"><I>Nature</I></A>
weighed in on a major scientific controversy that has its roots in
pre-Darwin embryology, fueled by some gigantic scientific
personalities and even tinged with what some would call fraud. This
intense scientific dispute spawned a sort of doppelganger,
a manufactured controversy that is just one more invention of
anti-evolution propagandists. The <I>Nature</I> cover story gives us
a great opportunity to look into the controversies, real and
imagined, and to learn a lot about evolution and development and the
things we're still trying to understand about both.</P>
<P>The scientific dispute is an old one, dating to when scientists
first began to study embryonic development in earnest. Embryologists
like the great <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ernst_von_Baer">Karl
Ernst von Baer</A> noticed that the embryos of very different animals
often <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9974/#A46">looked
so similar</A> that they could hardly be distinguished from each
other. A chicken embryo, at some point, looks an awful lot like a
human embryo. What does this mean? Two schools of thought (roughly
speaking) entered into competition, with evolution as the major
subtext. One set of ideas envisioned development as recapitulation:
development was a sort of re-play of evolution, with the organism
recapitulating its evolutionary history as it took shape.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory">Recapitulation
theory</A> was the brainchild of <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel">Ernst
Haeckel</A>, whose view of development was codified as his <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S1464793102005948/abstract">Biogenetic
Law</A> and sloganeered as "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."
Against recapitulation were the views of von Baer and others; von
Baer formulated his own <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9974/#A46">set
of laws</A>, the third of which repudiates recapitulation rather
directly. Everyone agreed that embryos of different animals often
looked quite alike; the dispute was about what this meant. And it
seems that those who opposed evolutionary explanations (like von
Baer) were eager to point to difference and divergence during
development, while those who championed evolutionary views wanted to
emphasize the shocking similarities between, say, chickens and
mammals when compared at key embryological junctures.</P>
<P>Haeckel, famously, went on to point to those similarities as
evidence for common ancestry and, infamously, to create a certain
illustration of that evidence. His picture, thought by even <A HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1cf2gngc2qee6efp/">some
embryologists</A> to be partly fraudulent (more accurately,
"doctored"), is now a staple of anti-evolution propaganda. You
can read all about that <A HREF="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/wells_and_haeckels_embryos.php">elsewhere</A>;
suffice it to say that Haeckel's drawings have long since been
"corrected" without creating any problems for evolutionary
theory. (For a much more detailed treatment of this saga, see
<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S1464793102005948/abstract">Richardson
and Keuck, <I>Biological Reviews</I>, 2002</A>.)</P><img alt="RichardsonPhylotypicLineupFromGilbert300px.jpg" src="/uploads/2010/RichardsonPhylotypicLineupFromGilbert300px.jpg" width="300" height="248" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" />
<P>But interestingly, the debates about recapitulation morphed (wink)
over the years into a distinct but related disagreement about whether
animal development passes through a stage that is common to - or
typical of - the lineage of the organism. Because although
Haeckel's recapitulation idea didn't survive, it remained clear that
development seemed to reflect evolutionary commonalities. Consider
the photos on the right. (The figure was created by Michael K. Richardson,
who led the research group that <A HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1cf2gngc2qee6efp/">critiqued
Haeckel's drawings in 1998</A>.) While the various embryos shown all
end up looking quite different - looking like the adult form, in
other words - they seem to "start" at a place that's notably
similar. (Compare the embryos in the first row.) That starting point
is not the beginning of development, and in fact those different
kinds of embryos got to that starting point via rather different
beginnings. In other words, it seems that animal embryos pass through
roughly three phases of development: an early phase that can vary
from group to group (say, between birds and mammals), a late phase in
which group-specific forms are established, and a middle phase that
is eerily similar among groups. That middle phase has come to be
known as the "<A HREF="http://books.google.com/books?id=BXfdbKLTiZQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">phylotypic
stage</A>" of development, meaning that it is a stage at which the
embryo looks like a typical example of its evolutionary group. For
insects, this is thought to be the "extended germband" stage; for
vertebrates, it's roughly the <a href="http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=242">tailbud stage</a>. The point is that there
is a middle phase of development during which animal embryos of
varying morphological destinies look very similar, even if their
earlier stages seemed very distinct. This model of developmental
trajectories, compared across groups, is known as the "hourglass
model," nicely depicted by <A HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1cf2gngc2qee6efp/">Richardson
and colleagues</A> in the cartoon on the left.</P><img alt="HourglassModelCartoonRichardson-etal250px.gif" src="/uploads/2010/HourglassModelCartoonRichardson-etal250px.gif" width="250" height="312" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />
<P>Why all the controversy? Well, the disputes all seem to be related
to the fact that the model is mostly descriptive. And so, one
criticism is that the model is based on what embryos look like, and
not strongly anchored in carefully-defined and -measured characters.
Moreover, some critics have noted that the comparisons were often
restricted to popular laboratory species, such that when the analysis
was expanded to include a broader set of species, the similarities in
the waist of the hourglass become less striking. In other words, the
dispute centered on the basis of the model. Critics were disputing
the very existence of the phylotypic stage.</P>
<P>Oh, and while this interesting scientific debate was ongoing, some
propagandists were <A HREF="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/wells_and_haeckels_embryos.php">shadowboxing
with Haeckel's ghost</A>, shrieking about fraud while creating in the
minds of their dupes the illusion of a different debate: one about
whether development and evolution are conceptually linked. Along the
way, these busy demagogues suggested that the phylotypic stage is an
illusion, cherry-picking their data more shamelessly than Haeckel
ever did. In any case, these folks were exploiting the real
scientific dispute: whether the phylotypic stage can be defined more
rigorously, in a way that links the similarities (whatever they are)
to common ancestry.</P><img alt="NatureCoverPhylotypic.jpg" src="/uploads/2010/NatureCoverPhylotypic.jpg" width="150" height="200" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" />
<P>And that brings us to the <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7325/index.html">cover
story in this week's issue of <I>Nature</I></A>. The cover image
depicts a version of Haeckel's infamous illustration. The issue
includes two reports, very different in their approach and in the
animals they examined. Both reports provide striking support for the
hourglass model, by showing that the phylotypic stage is indeed
characterized by distinctive and fascinating patterns of gene
expression. Part II will explore those two papers.</P><P>---</P>
