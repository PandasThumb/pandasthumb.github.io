  <p><strong>by Paul S. Braterman, University of Glasgow; Professor Emeritus, University of North Texas</strong></p>

<p>As you know by now, Behe has actually had a paper published in
a peer-reviewed scientific journal (Behe M.J., Quarterly Review of Biology 85(4), 2010, 419-415).
Well, not exactly a paper, more of a literature review. Well, not exactly a
literature review, more a review of previous reviews, reinterpreting their
findings according to his own criteria. The publication itself is shoddy piece
of work. I have written numerous reviews myself, and would never have dreamed
of basing them on earlier reviews, rather than my own up-to-date literature search.
But let that pass.</p>

<p>Behe constructs an elaborate apparatus for
classifying mutations as “gain”, “modification”, or
“loss” of what he calls a <em>Functional Coded Element</em> (FCT). The
definition is skewed to make “gain” as difficult to prove as
possible. The process needs to be understood at the molecular level, rather
than simply in terms of phenotype expression. This enables him to dismiss as of
unproven relevance the Lenski group’s famous demonstration of <em>E.Coli</em>
acquiring the ability to metabolise citrate under anaerobic conditions.
Moreover, advantageous removal of inhibition is treated as “loss”,
but advantageous disruption of a function by IS duplication and insertion is
classified as “modification”, rather than “gain”. Using
these restrictive and asymmetric criteria, Behe classifies most sufficiently
well-understood mutations in laboratory-bred bacteria as loss or modification,
although he does recognise a few gains.</p>

<p>Why bother with this eccentric-seeming
enterprise? Here we need to look at the broader context of Behe’s involvement
with the Discovery Institute.</p>

<p>The context makes him a colleague of William Dembski,
who notoriously claims that undirected evolution cannot even in principle
generate novel information. So Behe is concerned to minimise the importance of
cases where evolution has demonstrably done just that. The techniques he uses
invite analysis along the lines of the deconstruction by Boudry et al. of
creationist strategy,
which (through good luck, or cruel judgement, who knows?) appeared in the same
issue of Quarterly Review of Biology as the article under discussion. (Boudry
M., Blancke S., Braeckman J., Quarterly Review of
Biology 85(4), 2010, 473-482.)</p>

<p>The advocates of supernatural causation
start with the bold initial claim: that organisms cannot acquire new functions
by natural processes, since new information cannot be generated without the
intervention of an intelligence. Notice that this is a claim that such things
cannot happen, even in principle.</p>

<p>But there are numerous well-known counterexamples,
many of them discussed in this review.</p>

<p>The next stage is rhetorical dismissal of such
counterexamples. Here the strategies include limiting the search (ignoring the
massive creative role of gene duplication and polyploidy in eukaryotes, and of
horizontal transfer followed by selection in bacteria themselves), narrowing
the criteria (new functions don’t count unless they can be demonstrated to
arise from additions, rather than any other kinds of alterations, to the
molecular machinery), and inventing additional constraints (creation of a new
category, the FCT, classifying the process as a loss if either material or
function is lost at any stage in the change being discussed, dismissing changes
in function as mere transformations, rather than novelties). This stage switches
the emphasis from what is possible in principle, to the demand that each case
be demonstrated in practice, and fully analysed in detail, at the molecular
level.</p>

<p>Finally, any counterexamples still
surviving this moving of the goalposts and restricting and tilting of the
playing field are dismissed as untypical, and therefore unimportant. Another
leap of logic, as the present case shows. For even if losses (according to
Behe’s criteria) outnumber gains, losses are in general unlikely to be dramatic
without being lethal—there are some obvious well-known exceptions, such as the evolution
of parasitism—whereas dramatic gains such as gene duplication,
horizontal gene transfer, or polyploidy, can and do have the most profound
effects imaginable.</p>

<p>The whole process is a study in
indirection, closely related to the technique of the stage magician. We are
supposed to nod our heads wisely, and agree that real and difficult problems
have been raised, rather than noticing displacement of our attention away from
the initial claim. This, let me remind you, was that something is impossible
even in principle, and was more than adequately refuted by the very first counterexample.</p>

<p>The ultimate in indirection is the
promulgation of a new rule, rising phoenix-like from the ashes of the old,
while pretending to the same level of significance. In the present case we
have, to quote the article’s peroration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This reasoning can be concisely stated as what I call “The First Rule of Adaptive
Evolution”:</p>

  <p><em>Break or
blunt any functional coded element whose loss would yield a net fitness gain.</em></p>

  <p>It is called a
“rule” in the sense of being a rule of thumb. It is a heuristic, useful
generalization, rather than a strict law; other circumstances being equal, this
is what is usually to be expected in adaptive evolution</p>

  <p>(Emphasis in the original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, when it is advantageous to
lose an element of the molecular machinery, selection pressures are likely to
lead to its loss.</p>

<p>Did we really need 27 pages of prime journal space to tell us this?</p>
