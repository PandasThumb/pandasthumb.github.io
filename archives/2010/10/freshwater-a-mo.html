  <p>The Dennis family has made a request of the federal court in preparation for the filing of a motion to compel settlement in <a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/doe-v-freshwater-mv">Doe v. Mount Vernon Board of Education, et al.</a>, in which John Freshwater is the sole remaining defendant.  The request is to be permitted to file a motion under seal to compel settlement, the filing to be under seal because of the Court’s gag order concerning settlement negotiations.</p>

<p>Recall that the trial in that suit was slated to begin July 26, 2010, but Federal District Judge Gregory Frost nixed it under the impression that a settlement had been reached.  In his order granting sanctions against Freshwater and Hamilton on August 2, 2010, Frost wrote</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In their memorandum in opposition, Plaintiffs request judgement to be entered against Freshwater or for evidentiary inferences to be permitted against Freshwater at trial. <em>That request, however, has been rendered moot by the settlement of this matter.</em> (italics added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly Judge Frost thought a settlement had been reached, and since he has to approve any settlement he should know.</p>

<p>However, we’ve been waiting since then for an announcement of that settlement, and it hasn’t occurred.  Now comes the notice of intention to file a motion to compel settlement.  IANAL, but my impression is that a motion to compel settlement is filed when one party to an agreed settlement subsequently fails to adhere to the agreement.  (See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2axk6bo">here for that language</a>.)  I infer, therefore, that whatever settlement that was agreed in July 2010 hasn’t been stuck to by Freshwater and/or Hamilton, and hence this request and the prospective motion to compel.  Since Judge Frost’s gag order is still in effect concerning settlement discussions, all we have is the bare <a href="http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1432">request to file under seal</a> (pdf).  The request to file the motion under seal <a href="http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1433">was granted</a> (pdf) by Judge Frost so the motion to compel settlement may be imminent.</p>
