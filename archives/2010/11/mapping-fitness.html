  <div class="kw-format"><p>The concept of a "fitness landscape" is a fundamental idea in
evolutionary biology, first introduced and established during the
so-called "evolutionary synthesis" in the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century. It was the great Sewall Wright who pictured adaptation as a
"walk" through a landscape (pictured below), where the walking is done by variants
(of an organism or a molecule) and the landscape is a theoretical
representation of the relative fitness of the variants. (J.B.S.
Haldane did similar work around the same time, but <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp" rel="external ">Wright's
paper</a> is much better known perhaps because it's more accessible
to non-experts. See <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/suppl.1/1747.full" rel="external ">Carneiro
and Hartl</a> in <em>PNAS </em>earlier this year for more.)</p>


<p class="kw-img-center"><img src="/uploads/2010/SewallWrightLandscape1932-300px.gif" alt="SewallWrightLandscape1932-300px.gif" width="300" height="220" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" class="mt-image-right" /></p>

<p>It's a simple concept, and a helpful one, though sometimes subject
to over-interpretation. And it helps to frame some of the big
questions in evolutionary genetics. One of those big questions is
this one, stated somewhat simplistically: how do the variants
navigate to fitness peaks, if there are fitness valleys that separate
the peaks? (The ideas is that fitness is higher on the peaks, and so
a population would be unlikely to descend from a local peak into a
valley.) In other words, given a particular fitness landscape, what
are the evolutionary trajectories by which variation can explore that
landscape?</p>


<p>Such a question calls out for an experiment. It would be so nice
to be able to map fitness landscapes using hard data, so as to design
and perform experiments on the navigation of adaptive walks.
Specifically, this would facilitate an empirical examination of the
genetic structure underlying the fitness landscape, and that's how a
lot of the interesting questions about evolutionary exploration will
be addressed. Of course, biologists have been working on this for a
long time, and we've <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/abs/nature05451.html">learned a lot about real fitness landscapes</a> over
the decades. But detailed maps of such landscapes require detailed
knowledge of the genetics of the landscape, and that has presented a
significant technical challenge. Because of these technical
limitations, examination of fitness landscapes have been either
highly focused on very small landscapes (say, the fitness of a small
number of variants) or have described the landscapes at very low
resolution (by analyzing a tiny subset of the possible variants).</p>


<p>It's worth taking some time to understand the problem before we
look at how new techniques and approaches are changing the situation.</p>


<p>Look at Wright's drawing. It looks like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map" rel="external ">topographical
(topo) map</a>, with dotted lines indicating parts of the landscape
that represent equal fitness. And it looks smooth, like a topo map of
rolling hills or dunes. The elevations represent fitness, but what do
the lateral distances represent? They represent variation: more
specifically, each point on the map represents one particular genetic
variant. It doesn't matter whether we're talking about a whole genome
navigating a complex fitness landscape or a single protein navigating
a map of one specific function. Either way, each point on the map is
a different variant. And, importantly, each point on the map is
adjacent to many other points on the map, such that a tiny change (a
single nucleotide change in a DNA sequence, for example) results in a
step from one point to an adjacent point. This means that a map
like Wright's is likely to depict the postulated fitness of enormous
numbers of variants: even a seemingly simple map of the function of one molecule, in order to be a complete map, would have to account
for millions of potential variants. (For example, an average-sized protein composed of 400 amino acids can be made 20<sup>400</sup> different
ways.) Even if the map only seeks to account for the function of a
small part of a protein, say, 10 amino acids, that's still 20<sup>10</sup>
different possibilities. That's a lot of possibilities.</p>


<p>And that's a problem for at least one reason. Wright's map shows a
smooth landscape, in which changes in fitness happen in small
increments as the variants diverge from each other. His map creates
the impression that closely-related variants will differ only
slightly in fitness from each other. But reality could be completely
different in a given case. It could be that the real landscape is a
crazy cacophony of varying fitnesses, with an aerial topography more
like downtown Manhattan than like the dunes of West Michigan. And it
could be a mixture of both: smoothly varying overall topography that
arises from more dramatically varying local topography.</p>


<p>To tackle such a problem, we would need to be able to measure the
fitness of zillions of variants, in such a way as to be able to link
the fitness measurement to the exact genetic makeup of each variant.
In more technical terms, we need to describe/measure phenotypes of
zillions of genotypes, and we need to know both the phenotype and the
genotype of each of those zillions of variants. How can this be
accomplished, or is it even possible?</p>


<p>Three recent papers serve as excellent examples of how scientists
are working on questions like this. One notable thing about the
papers is, of course, the fact that they have tackled this seemingly
intractable problem. Another is the technological advance
(<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/10/1638.abstract">next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing</a>) that largely explains the
breakthrough success of two of the research groups. And another is
the fact that all three labs are located in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=seattle&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Seattle,+King,+Washington&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=_0boTM66DYjNngeQ_OijDQ&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ved=0CC4Q8gEwAA&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">one particular
metropolitan area</a>, an area that is home to an anti-scientific think
tank that claims to be interested in the very same questions.</p>


<p>We'll explore those three papers in three subsequent posts. But if
