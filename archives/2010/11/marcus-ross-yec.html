  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_R._Ross">Marcus Ross</a> is a young-earth creationist who was recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/science/12geologist.html">awarded a Ph.D.</a> in vertebrate paleontology by the University of Rhode Island.  He now <a href="https://www.liberty.edu/academics/arts-sciences/biology-chemistry/index.cfm?PID=11778">teaches at Liberty University</a>, which (IIRC, according to the acknowledgments in his dissertation) partly supported his doctoral work.  Ross claims that he can both be a YEC, using his credential to bolster his teaching of Flood geology, and also work honestly in the framework of orthodox geology simply by switching “paradigms” according to (audience) context.</p>

<p>Ross presents work at standard geological conferences, and Joe Meert, a geologist at the University of Florida and a long-time creationism watcher, <a href="http://scienceantiscience.blogspot.com/2010/11/marcus-ross-two-faced-again.html">recently attended a presentation by Ross</a> on correlating Cretaceous ammonite fossils in order to more firmly date the mosasaur fossils that were the topic of his dissertation research.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentation Meert asked Ross how he squared his YEC beliefs with a presentation that dated fossils to millions of years ago.  According to Meert, Ross answered, “My talk had nothing to do with a global flood or a 6000 year old earth so your question is irrelevant.”  When Meert pressed, Ross replied (Meert’s paraphrase)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok, for everyone in the audience who doesn’t know it, yes I am a young earth creationist who believes the Earth is 6000 years old and a global flood took place. However, I am not speaking as a young earth creationist here. When I speak at young earth creationist meetings I use a different framework than when I speak at the Geological Society of America meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What struck me was Meert’s comment that several people felt sorry for Ross for being pushed to acknowledge his YEC beliefs and wondered why Meert was so harsh with him.  Meert’s response is perfect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marcus Ross is just one of many two-faced creationists and I’m going to call them out on this hypocrisy any chance I get.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read Meert’s <a href="http://scienceantiscience.blogspot.com/2010/11/marcus-ross-two-faced-again.html">whole post</a> as well as <a href="http://scienceantiscience.blogspot.com/2007/02/two-faces-of-dr-ross.html">Meert’s earlier post on Ross</a>.  I hope the student he mentions who went on a field trip led by Ross and two other YEC geologists does a guest post on it.</p>
