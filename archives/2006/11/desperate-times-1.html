  <p>On <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1770">UcD</a> our dear friend Salvador Cordova shows how the recent political, scientific and legal disasters to Intelligent Design have made the movement desperate for some ‘good news’. According to Sal, the good news comes in the form of 30% of community college professors considering ID to be science.</p>

<p>So let’s look at <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/gross/religions.pdf">the study</a> in question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study was done by two sociologists, Neil Gross of Harvard University and Solon Simmons of George Mason University. They contacted 1,471 professors at religious and secular colleges and asked about politics and faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/living/15959974.htm">Praying for an ‘A’ might not impress your prof</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We also asked respondents to weigh in on the controversy over intelligent design.  Our  question asked respondents how much they agreed or disagreed with the following  statement: “The theory of intelligent design IS a serious scientific alternative to the  Darwinian theory of evolution.”  Overall, 84.1 percent of professors surveyed disagreed  with the statement, with 75.3 percent registering strong disagreement.  Agreement was  strongest at community colleges, where 30.6 percent of professors see intelligent design  as a serious scientific alternative, and weakest at elite doctoral universities, where just 5.6 percent of professors do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly enough the data to do not allow one to determine if community colleges tend to be more religious in nature, nor if these professors where involved in the science. In fact, is there a difference in the distribution of courses on colleges and universities versus community colleges?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if the news that 30% of community college professors support the concept that ID is a serious scientific contender, is the best news ID has to present… Of course, Sal’s posting is nothing compared to the incomprehensible mutterings of Denyse O’Leary. Then again, she has the excuse that she is not really a scientist at all.</p>

<p>The survey however does indicate that professors are hardly the atheists some Christian make them out to be.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough a relatively large amount of professors proclaim themselves to be born-again</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nor are born-again Christians only to be found at religiously-affiliated institutions, though they are present  there in greater numbers.  17 percent of professors at secular schools describe themselves as born-again Christians, as compared to 29.6 percent at religiously-affiliated schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At elite doctoral institutions, the numbers are significantly smaller</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Professors who are born-again are extremely rare at elite doctoral institutions, composing only about one  percent of professors at such institutions,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would be interesting to see if religious beliefs and the belief that ID is a valid scientific alternative also correlate. I am not sure that Sal should be happy about these findings, but then again, good news is slim pickings nowadays amongst ID activists.</p>
