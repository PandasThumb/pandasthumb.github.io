  <p>Over at the ARN blog, Denyse O’Leary has <a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/2/2006/11/15/lstrongglemgintroduction_l_emg_peer_revi">a four-part article</a> up attacking the peer-review system. Rob Crowther, of the Discovery Institute’s 
Media Complaints Division, has chimed in <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/11/is_peerreview_the_end_all_and.html">with his own post</a> on the topic. There’s a great deal of humor in watching anti-evolutionists try to dismiss peer review as not worth the effort anyway. It bears an amazing resemblance to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_grapes">really cute old fable about a fox</a>, but I’ll be kind and pretend that there is actually something more to the O’Leary and Crowther rants than good old sour grapes.</p>

<p>Their major complaint about peer review is, of course, that their stuff, for some bizarre and unaccountable reason, has a really hard time surviving the process. In Crowther’s words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To sum up, science journals that are wedded to Darwinian evolution refuse to publish authors who explicitly advocate intelligent design. Then Darwinists attack intelligent design as unscientific because it isn’t published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>O’Leary puts it a bit differently, but the basic concept is the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a modest but growing number of ID-friendly peer-reviewed publications. But - given the woeful state of peer review - papers that support or undermine ID hypotheses would probably be neither better nor worse recommended if they were never peer reviewed, just published, amid cheers and catcalls..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, they try to justify their criticism of peer review on grounds other than their inability to reach the grapes. Peer review, they claim, doesn’t identify fraud. It’s not that good at catching incorrect findings. It squelches new ideas. It places “intellectual pygmies” in judgement of intellectual giants. It favors consensus. It sucks the life out of people, and is entirely responsible for global hunger and bad hair days. OK, I made the last two up, but you should still get a taste for the basic strategy that’s being employed here - it’s an oldie, but a goodie. Throw as much crap as you can at the wall, and hope that some of it sticks.</p>

<p>In this case, some of it does stick. It should. Peer review is not a perfect system. It is absolutely flawed. It is, in fact, not good at catching fraud. It does not catch many flawed studies. It does make it more difficult to publish new ideas, and it is absolutely capable of sucking the will to live from people. (Just because I made that one up doesn’t mean it isn’t right.) To paraphrase Churchill, peer review is the worst system out there, except for all the others that have been tried.</p>
