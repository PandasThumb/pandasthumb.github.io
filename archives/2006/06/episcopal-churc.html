  <p>On Wednesday, June 14, 2006, the Episcopal News Services reported that the bishops had approved  Resolution <strong>A129 Affirm Creation and Evolution</strong>. The Resolution reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Resolved</strong>, the House of_____ concurring, That the 75th General Convention affirm that God is Creator, in accordance with the witness of Scripture and the ancient Creeds of the Church; and be it further,</p>

  <p><strong>Resolved</strong>, That the theory of evolution provides a fruitful and unifying scientific explanation for the emergence of life on earth, and that an acceptance of evolution in no way diminishes the centrality of Scripture in telling the stories of the love of God for the Creation and is entirely compatible with an authentic and living Christian faith; and be it further</p>

  <p><strong>Resolved</strong>, That Episcopalians strongly encourage state legislatures and state and local boards of education to establish standards for science education based on the best available scientific knowledge as accepted by a consensus of the scientific community; and be it further Resolved, That Episcopal dioceses and congregation seek the assistance of scientists and science educators in understanding what constitutes reliable scientific knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resolution also explains the rationale namely that evolution is broadly accepted and that it is the best explanation of how life evolved.</p>

<p>I am happy to see that there are still some churches left that support good science and are willing to take a stance against the argument from ignorance promoted by the Intelligent Design movement. While undoubtably, the Episcopal Church will be ridiculed by some, it seems to me that when it comes to Christian behavior, others have much to learn from this Church.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

  <p>The theory of evolution is broadly accepted by the overwhelming majority in the scientific community as the most adequate explanation for the emergence of life on earth, and the ongoing adaptation of life to changes in environments. For example, knowledge of how evolution functions is essential in understanding the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, the resistance of insects to insecticides, and the appearance of viruses such as HIV and influenza.</p>

  <p>The teaching of evolution is a crucial contribution to the development of scientific literacy among the nation’s youth, yet state legislators and state and local school boards continue to challenge, limit, or seek to supplant the teaching of evolution. Limiting the teaching of evolution in our schools has the potential to compromise students’ ability to understand constantly changing living systems, and may undermine, for instance, the understanding and treatment of diseases of the future.</p>

  <p>Since the sixteenth century, Anglicans have described their faith in terms of the “three-legged stool” of Scripture, Tradition and Reason. The quest to understand the origins of life on earth, and the forces that drive the ongoing changes in living organisms involves Reason and is in no way incompatible with the central truths of Scripture and Christian Tradition. Episcopalians generally accept that it is appropriate to seek to understand, through scientific probing, the origins both of the cosmos and life on earth, and that evolution is a valid explanation of the development of all living things, including humanity. Several leading Anglican theologians, past and present, among them priest-scientists William G. Pollard, Arthur Peacocke, and Sir John Polkinghorne, have shown how an evolutionary world view can be integrated with a theology of creation. The 67th General Convention affirmed a belief “in the glorious ability of God to create in any manner”, and its “support of scientists, educators, and theologians in the search for truth” (GC Resolution 1982-D090).</p>
