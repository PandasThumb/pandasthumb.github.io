  <p><img src="http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/graphics/frontpage/masthead.gif" alt="" style="float:left;" />The <em>Pensacola News-Journal</em> is doing fantastic work keeping us up to date on the Hovind story.  <a href="http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060714/NEWS01/607140333/1006">A longer and more detailed story came out today</a>.  Some of the more interesting/scary bits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the 58 charges, 44 were filed against Kent Hovind and his wife, Jo, for evading bank reporting requirements as they withdrew $430,500 from AmSouth Bank between July 20, 2001, and Aug. 9, 2002.</p>

  <p>At the couple’s first court appearance Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Miles Davis, Kent Hovind professed not to understand why he is being prosecuted. Some 20 supporters were in the courtroom.</p>

  <p>“I still don’t understand what I’m being charged for and who is charging me,” he said.</p>

  <p>Kent Hovind, who often calls himself “Dr. Dino,” has been sparring with the IRS for at least 17 years on his claims that he is employed by God, receives no income, has no expenses and owns no property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet more:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The indictment also says the Hovinds’ made cash withdrawals from AmSouth Bank in a manner that evaded federal requirements for reporting cash transactions.</p>

  <p>The withdrawals were for $9,500 or $9,600, just below the $10,000 starting point for reporting cash transactions.</p>

  <p>Most of the withdrawals were days apart. For example, the indictment shows three withdrawals of $9,500 each on July 20, July 23 and July 26 in 2001.</p>

  <p>The indictment also charges Kent Hovind with impeding an IRS investigation.</p>

  <p>Among the ways he is accused of doing:</p>

  <p>* Filing a frivolous lawsuit against the agency demanding damages for criminal trespass.</p>

  <p>* Filing an injunction against an IRS special agent.</p>

  <p>* Filing false complaints against the IRS for false arrest, excessive use of force and theft.</p>

  <p>* Making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation.</p>

  <p>Judge Davis released the Hovinds from custody pending their trial, which will be scheduled during their arraignment at 2 p.m. Monday.</p>

  <p>Over Kent Hovind’s protests, the judge took away his passport and guns Hovind claimed belonged to his church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although seeing “church” and “guns” in the same sentence is disturbing in itself,  I don’t think we should jump to conclusions about the guns – maybe Hovind just has a deer rifle and says that all of his property, including guns, belongs to his church – but perhaps some of our legal beagle readers could see if any online legal documents have details.</p>
