  <p>Kenneth Miller, professor at Brown University and expert witness for the plaintiffs in the <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</em>, replied to William A. ‘Divine Wind’ Dembski this morning with some suggestions for good video. I know I’d like to see it. Fortunately, he used “reply all” in responding to Dembski, so I got it in my inbox. I thought that the PT community would like to see it, too, so I asked Prof. Miller if I could get his permission to post his email, and he kindly agreed. It is appended below the fold.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Bill,</p>

  <p>Thanks for the e-mail.  It’s great to see what sort of research the Intelligent Design movement is up to these days!</p>

  <p>I’d like to help you with the Judge’s e-mail, but since I have never had any contact with him outside the courtroom, I have no idea what his e-mail might be.  I’m sure he’d be thrilled by the offer to remove “less flattering” sound effects, of course.</p>

  <p>I do believe that I can help you with the video, though.  As much as I enjoyed it, I was disappointed that it didn’t include some of the more amusing events from the trial.  Since you’ve clearly got a little extra time on your hands, why not punch it up a bit with a few more highlights?</p>

  <p>For example, how about Bill Buckingham claiming that he never mentioned the word “creationism,” and then the video clip showing him doing exactly that? (I can send you the clip if you need it).  Or Mike Behe peeking out from behind a stack of 58 papers, 9 books, and a couple of textbooks saying that even this isn’t enough to convince him that the immune system evolved?  Or, even better, your own DC spokesman for the Discovery Institute (Mark Ryland) claiming that the DI had “never” advocated the teaching of ID in schools, followed by Richard Thompson, in his own voice, waving a copy of Steve Meyer’s book which advocated exactly that? I’ve got that last one on a DVD if you like. You’d love it, Bill - Richard brought down the house at the American Enterprise Institute with that one.</p>

  <p>Or, even better, how about the stuff before the trial?</p>

  <p>Why not show the pictures of the 8 ID experts who promised the Dover Board that they would be there in court to defend them? … and then you can show 5 of the 8 running away at deposition time. I’ve even got a sound effects file I can send you of galloping horses, and maybe a scream or two in the background as the dreaded experts from the ACLU-friendly plaintiffs arrive?</p>

  <p>Now that would be one heckuva animation!</p>

  <p>Best Wishes for a Wonderful Christmas,</p>

  <p>Ken</p>

<p>I’ll offer a trivial correction to Prof. Miller, in that while 5 ID experts dropped out before testifying, only 3 of those did so at deposition time: John Angus Campbell, William A. ‘Divine Wind’ Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer. Bruce Chapman apparently told the Discovery Institute affiliated experts that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002953668_id26m.html">they shouldn’t get involved in KvD</a>, and those three appear to have complied with Chapman’s wishes. Warren Nord and Dick M. Carpenter II saved their running away for during the trial itself – we have the depositions <a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/depo/2005-06-07_deposition_Nord.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/depo/2005-05-17_deposition_Carpenter.pdf">here</a>, respectively. One may speculate upon why the Thomas More Law Center decided to do without their testimony. In Nord’s case, perhaps his insistence that religion should be a part of the educational curriculum despite what the Constitution and courts have said about that was recognized by the TMLC as shooting themselves in the foot, which would have been close to a first for them. (Recognizing it ahead of time, that is.) In Carpenter’s case, apparently TMLC figured out how dispensable Carpenter’s testimony was – several months after I had surmised as much.</p>
