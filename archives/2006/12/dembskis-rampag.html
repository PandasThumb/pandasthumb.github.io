  <p>On UncommonDescent, Dembski ‘explains’ his motivation behind the Judge Jones School of law:</p>

<p>Dembksi wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just to be clear, my aim in this flash animation was not to shake up the convictions of convinced Darwinists. Rather, my aim was to render Judge Jones and his decision ridiculous in the eyes of many young people, who from here on will never take Darwinian evolution or him seriously. If the cost of accomplishing this is yet another lowering of my estimation in the eyes of PT or Richard Dawkins, that’s a price I’m only too glad to pay — heck, I regard that as a benefit of the deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Opderdeck correctly observes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem here is three-fold, IMHO: (1) it inculcates a disrespect for the legal system; (2) it rests on a false premise of “plagiarism”; and (3) it discredits your substantive work, particularly among those of us who really know how the legal process works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Davescot tried to object and David responded</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I said: 1) it inculcates a disrespect for the legal system;</p>

  <p>DaveScot said: <em>When the shoe fits…</em></p>

  <p>My problem with this is that, as a Christian, I’m bound by Romans 13, which says: Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. … Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</p>

  <p>There’s simply no way I can reconcile this with false allegations and farting noises. (Civil disobedience is a different matter; even when appropriate, it must be done respectfully. Compare Rosa Parks’ dignified place on the segregated bus, or MLK Jr.’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, with farting noises).</p>

  <p><em>That’s a matter of opinion. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it’s probably a duck.</em></p>

  <p>That horse is dead. It neither walks or quacks like a duck. It’s a different animal altogether because of the context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dembski reveals his true motivation</p>

<p>Dembski wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me suggest you all read your Old Testament — Elijah taunting the prophets of Baal (and then, oh my, killling them); Micaiah the prophet telling Ahab the king to look forward to his coming death; and Jehu’s respectful treatment of Queen Jezebel (throwing her out a window and letting the dogs lap up her blood). And then in the New Testament we find Paul wishing that certain Judaizers didn’t just circumcise themselves but would go the whole way and castrate themselves. I see the JJSchLaw as an instrument of grace to bring Dawkins and others to their senses (if such a thing were possible). What have you done lately, dopderbeck, to jar Dawkins out of his dogmatic rampage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dembski’s no prophet… Certainly Dembski is no Paul…</p>

<p>But it is nice to see that all this denigrating of Judge Jones serves a religious purpose. ID’s true colors have once again be revealed. Judge Jones stands strong in his observations. For that I thank Dembski.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, David was put on moderation…</p>

<p>Soon thereafter Dembski announced that he had removed the flatulence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Rembrandt of flash animation and I are working to enhance “The Judge Jones School of Law.” As a first step we have made the animation less offensive to more refined sensibilities. All the overt flatulence has therefore been removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I posted some comments on the “overwhelming” website my user name was quickly blocked and my contributions deleted. Seems that ID is not ready to teach the controversy to its audience.</p>
