<p class="lead">What has always attracted me to developmental biology is the ability to see the unfolding of pattern&mdash;simplicity becomes complexity in a process made up of small steps, comprehensible physical and chemical interactions that build a series of states leading to a <i>mostly</i> robust conclusion. It's a bit like <a href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">Conway's Game of Life</a> in reverse, where we see the patterns and can manipulate them to some degree, but we don't know the underlying rules, and that's our job&mdash;to puzzle out how it all works.</p>

<img align="right" alt="compoundeye.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2006/03/compoundeye.jpg" width="170" height="170" />

<p>Another fascinating aspect of development is that all the intricate, precise steps are carried out <i>without agency</i>: everything is explained and explainable in terms of local, autonomous interactions. Genes are switched on in response to activation by proteins not conscious action, domains of expression are refined without an interfering hand nudging them along towards a defined goal. It's teleonomy, not teleology. We see gorgeously regular structures like the insect compound eye to the right arise out of a smear of cells, and there is <i>no magic involved</i>&mdash;it's wonderfully empowering. We don't throw up our hands and declare a miracle, but instead science gives us the tools to look deeper and work out (with much effort, admittedly) <i>how</i> seeming miracles occur.</p>

<p>One more compelling aspect of development: it's reliable, but not rigid. Rather than being simply deterministic, development is built up on stochastic processes&mdash;ultimately, it's all chemistry, and cells changing their states are simply ping-ponging through a field of potential interactions to arrive at an equilibrium state probabilistically. When I'd peel open a grasshopper embryo and look at its ganglia, I'd have an excellent idea of what cells I'd find there, and what they'd be doing&hellip;but the fine details would vary every time. I can watch a string of neural crest cells in a zebrafish crawl out of the dorsal midline and stream over generally predictable paths to their destinations, but the actions of an individual melanocyte, for instance, are variable and beautiful to see. We developmental biologists get the best of all situations, a generally predictable pattern coupled to and generated by diversity and variation.</p>

<p>One of the best known examples of chance and regularity in development is the compound eye of insects, shown above, which is as lovely and crystalline as a snowflake, yet is visibly assembled from an apparently homogenous field of cells in the embryo. And looking closer, we discover a combination of very tight precision sprinkled with random variation.</p>
