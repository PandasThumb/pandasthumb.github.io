  <p>On January 28, 2006 Kansas Citizens for Science and the National Center for Science Education sponsored “Intelligent Design, Kansas Science Education, and the Law” at the Dole Institute of Politics in Lawrence, Kansas.</p>

<p>Featured speakers were three of the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Kitzmiller v. Dover case: Eric Rothschild and Steve Harvey of Pepper Hamilton LLP and Richard Katskee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p>

<p>Other speakers were Jack Krebs, president of Kansas Citizens for Science, Dr. Steve Case, co-chair of the Kansas science standards writing committee, and moderator Dr. Eugenie Scott, Executive Director of the National Center of Science Education.  Special guest Pedro Irigonegarary, representative for mainstream science at the Kansas Board of Education “Science Hearings” in May 2005, also spoke.</p>

<p>There were two themes of the forum.  One was that the decision in the Dover case clearly showed that the Intelligent Design movement was the latest incarnation of creationism:   Intelligent Design is not science but rather a disguise for religiously-based creationist beliefs.  Thus the Dover school district policy was declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The second theme was that if the Kansas science standards were held to the same criteria and scrutiny as the Dover policy, the Kansas science standards would also be unconstitutional.  ID movement leaders claim that the Dover criteria would not apply to the Kansas science standards because the standards merely “teach the controversy” without teaching ID.  However, if the history and context of the standards are examined, this claim is shown to be false.</p>

<p>The presentations were educational, engaging, and consistently to the point .  You can now listen yourself to all or part of the speeches and the question and answers session with the panelists.  <strong>Audio files in mp3 format</strong> as well as other information can be found <a href="http://www.kcfs.org/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=6;t=000002"><strong>*** here ***</strong></a> at “ID, Science Education and the Law” on the Kansas Citizens for Science discussion forums.</p>

<p>This was a very interesting, timely, and relevant event, and we invite you all to share it with us.  We look forward to your comments, either here or on our discussion forum.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jack Krebs
President, <a href="http://www.kcfs.org">Kansas Citizens for Science</a></p>
