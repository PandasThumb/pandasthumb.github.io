  <p>A Young Bush Appointee Resigns His Post at NASA New York Times - 9 hours ago George C. Deutsch, the young presidential appointee at NASA who told  public affairs workers to limit reporters’ access to a top climate  scientist and told a Web designer to add the word “theory” at every mention  of the Big Bang, resigned yesterday, agency officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/politics/08nasa.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">NY Times</a></p>

<p>In an <a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/bush_gang_appoi.html">earlier email sent by Deutsch to Flint Wild</a>, a Nasa contractor Deutsch stated:</p>

<p>Deutsch wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Big Bang is “not proven fact; it is opinion,” Mr. Deutsch wrote, adding, “It is not NASA’s place, nor should it be to make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator.”</p>

  <p>It continued: “This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA. That would mean we had failed to properly educate the very people who rely on us for factual information the most.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keith B Miller explains in his paper titled “Countering Public Misconceptions About the Nature of Evolutionary Science”, published in the Georgia Journal of Science, Vol 63:3, 2005 why the word theory is often poorly understood by the public since it suggests to the public a speculation or guess rather than its more common scientific meaning.</p>

<p>Keith B Miller wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theories are viewed as merely unsubstantiated guesses, rather than as the unifying concepts that give our observations coherence and meaning, provide us with a basis to make testable predictions, and ultimately to solve scientific problems. As a result, many people are unable to distinguish valid scientific conclusions from pseudoscience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, ID activists leverage this lack of understanding to further their argument that evolutionary science is inherently atheistic:</p>

<p>Keith B Miller wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For traditional creationists and most Intelligent Design (ID) supporters, the conviction that evolutionary theory and orthodox Christian faith are in irreconcilable conflict is fundamental. It is also a central part of the political strategy of the ID movement. As stated by Phillip Johnson, one of the founders and leaders of the ID movement: “The objective [of the Wedge Strategy] is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the nonexistence of God.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evolutionary science is ‘just a theory’ or the Big Bang is ‘just a theory’ does a disservice to how the public understands science and it is a crucial part of the political and religious movement known as “Intelligent Design”</p>

<p>Hint: THe big bang does not discount an intelligent designer…</p>

<p>But I digress:</p>

<p>Reed Cartwright has already commented on the <a href="/archives/2006/02/dont-let-the-ha-1.html">Downfall of Deutsch</a></p>

<p>Deutsch got into the limelight when James Hansen told the <a href="http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2006/01/turning_up_the_.html">New York Times</a> that political appointees, include Mr Deutsch, “were pressing to limit Dr. Hansen’s speaking and interviews on the threats posed by global warming”. The same story also ran in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/28/AR2006012801021.html">Washington Post</a></p>

<p>The problem is that the issue with Deutsch’s educational record distracts from the real problem, namely the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/science/04climate.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1139202453-aRfvnecFejetQDaeyLxFUQ">Bush administration’s efforts to silence those who disagree</a> with the president or the president’s policies.</p>

<p>James Hansen wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday, Dr. Hansen said that the questions about Mr. Deutsch’s credentials were important, but were a distraction from the broader issue of political control of scientific information.</p>

  <p>“He’s only a bit player,” Dr. Hansen said of Mr. Deutsch. “ The problem is much broader and much deeper and it goes across agencies. That’s what I’m really concerned about.”</p>

  <p>“On climate, the public has been misinformed and not informed,” he said. “The foundation of a democracy is an informed public, which obviously means an honestly informed public. That’s the big issue here.”</p>
</blockquote>
