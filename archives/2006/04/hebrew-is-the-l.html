  <p>I will demonstrate in this paper that all the Indo-European languages and probably all languages on earth evolved from ancient Hebrew.</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom is that Hebrew and the languages of Europe share only three words: <em>amen</em>, <em>hallelu-Yah</em>, and <em>Kokah-Kolah</em>. The 3000-year-old manuscripts known as the Dead Ashkenaz Scrolls, however, contain ancient Hebrew roots so old that they are not found in the Hebrew Bible: they survive only in Yiddish. This discovery dispels the usual belief that Yiddish is a Germanic language; rather, the manuscripts show that German is a Yiddic language.</p>

<p>Many of the newly discovered roots are familiar to speakers of Yiddish and natives of the New York metropolitan area. For example, the root <em>shlep</em> means to bear a heavy load, as in the sentence, “Ani shilafti mishpachti le-‘Ir ha-Strassim; I carted my family to Strasbourg.” The Strassim were an early group of city dwellers and probably invented the street.</p>

<p>On the way to ‘Ir ha-Strassim, the ancient Ashkenazit had to amuse her children with a <em>tsatskeh</em>. Often, when a <em>tsatskeh</em> fell apart after a few minutes of use, the Ashkenazit complained that it was a piece of <em>shlock</em>.</p>

<p>The root <em>shmuz</em> belongs to an irregular conjugation or one that has been lost. It means to chat amiably, as in “Hu shmuz ‘im El-Sah ba-gan; he is chatting with Elsa in the garden.” A root with a similar meaning, <em>kibits</em>, survives in modern Hebrew in the word kibbutz and the verb, to gather. The original meaning, however, was to watch a game and make comments: “Hee kibtsah shachmat; she was kibitzing a game of chess.”</p>

<p>When an ancient Ashkenazic Jew prayed fervently, he used the root, <em>daven</em>.  This root is the origin of the English word divine and the Latin, deus. The ancient Ashkenazi <em>bentshed</em>, or prayed after his meals. The Latin word benedicere, to bless, derives from <em>bentsh</em>.  To eat between meals was represented by a separate root, <em>nosh</em>, and you generally did not have to <em>bentsh</em> after a <em>nosh</em>.</p>

<p>To swell with pride was represented by the root, <em>kvell</em>: “Sabah kivel be-bar hamitsvah; Grandfather swelled with pride at the bar-mitzvah boy.” Afterward, Grandfather sometimes became crotchety, and a closely related root developed: <em>kvetsh</em>.</p>

<p>To work very hard was to <em>shvits</em>: “Ani shvitsti kol ha-yom; I worked hard all day.” If you labored hard in hot weather, you perspired a lot, so the verb eventually took on a slightly different meaning. Not everyone worked hard, even in those days, however; those who begged for a living were said to <em>shnorr</em>, and they could make quite a <em>tsimmes</em> if you didn’t give them some food or a little <em>gelt</em>.</p>

<p>In principle, all Hebrew words are derived from one of a thousand or so three-letter roots. These roots in turn derive from a smaller number of two-letter roots; for example, <em>kvell</em> (K-V-L) and <em>kvetsh</em> (K-V-Tsh) probably derive from the two-letter root K-V, to show emotion. In a later paper, I will show that Hebrew itself was not given by G-d but rather evolved from a single one-letter root, V, most likely a primal scream, “Vaaaaaayyyyyy!”</p>

<p><strong>About the author</strong>.  The author can conjugate Hebrew, even if he can’t speak it.</p>

<p><strong>Glossary</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>.  Yiddish is not German, so I have transliterated <em>sh</em> as <em>sh</em>, not <em>sch</em>.  When Germans recognize the Yiddic roots of their language, they will drop the <em>c</em>.</p>
