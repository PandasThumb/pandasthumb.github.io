<p>As we reflect upon the amazing body of work left behind by this giant of the movie scene, readers of the Thumb should know (if they don’t already) that Roger Ebert was a passionate defender of science, and of evolution in particular.</p>

<p>His passion was not un-noticed by creationists (of both young-earth and intelligent design categories). William Dembski had this to say about Ebert in an <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/roger-ebert-film-critic-expert-on-evolution-id-basher-and-overall-supergenius/">Uncommon Descent blog from 2006</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roger Ebert: Film Critic, Expert on Evolution, ID Basher, and Overall Supergenius …
… Or is Ebert just another clueless bonehead whose imagined expertise is in exact disproportion to his actual knowledge …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some memorable comments by Ebert on creationism, evolution, and religion.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/win_ben_steins_mind.html">Win Ben Stein’s mind, December 3, 2008</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more you know about evolution, or simple logic, the more you are likely to be appalled by the film. No one with an ability for critical thinking could watch more than three minutes without becoming aware of its tactics. It isn’t even subtle. Take its treatment of Dawkins, who throughout his interviews with Stein is honest, plain-spoken, and courteous. As Stein goes to interview him for the last time, we see a makeup artist carefully patting on rouge and dusting Dawkins’ face. After he is prepared and composed, after the shine has been taken off his nose, here comes plain, down-to-earth, workaday Ben Stein. So we get the vain Dawkins with his effete makeup, talking to the ordinary Joe.</p>

  <p>I have done television interviews for more than 40 years. I have been on both ends of the questions. I have news for you. Everyone is made up before going on television. If they are not, they will look like death warmed over. There is not a person reading this right now who should go on camera without some kind of makeup. Even the obligatory “shocked neighbors” standing in their front yards after a murder usually have some powder brushed on by the camera person. Was Ben Stein wearing makeup? Of course he was. Did he whisper to his camera crew to roll while Dawkins was being made up? Of course he did. Otherwise, no camera operator on earth would have taped that. That incident dramatizes his approach throughout the film. If you want to study Gotcha! moments, start here.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/04/how_i_believe_in_g.html">How I believe in God, April 17, 2009</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During in all the endless discussions on several threads of this blog about evolution, intelligent design, God and the afterworld, now numbering altogether around 3,500 comments, I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, or at the very least a secular humanist–which I am. If I were to say I don’t believe God exists, that wouldn’t mean I believe God <em>doesn’t</em> exist. Nor does it mean <em>I don’t know</em>, which implies that I <em>could</em> know.</p>

  <p>Let me rule out at once any God who has personally spoken to anyone or issued instructions to men. That some men believe they have been spoken to by God, I am certain. I do not believe Moses came down from the mountain with any tablets he did not go up with. I believe mankind in general evidently has a need to believe in higher powers and an existence not limited to the physical duration of the body. But these needs are hopes, and believing them doesn’t make them true.
…
No, I am not a Buddhist. I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/02/darwin_survives_as_the_fittest.html">Darwin survives as the fittest, February 11, 2009</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The True Believers. Found in both parties. One side declares God without any doubt <em>does</em> exist, and created the universe and everything in it. A much smaller subset of this group is convinced that God did this in fairly recent times–as little as 6,000 years ago, or in any event too recently for Darwin’s evolutionary process to have had enough time to take place. The other side declares that God without any doubt <em>does not</em> exist, and it is equally certain. Both sides frequently quote the Bible, on the one hand citing its truth, on the other side citing its falsity. Christianity is the only religion involved; my blog has readers from all over the world, but apparently those from elsewhere find Intelligent Design a uniquely American notion.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/09/the_longest_thread_evolves.html">The longest thread evolves, September 4, 2009</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The zealots of Creationism are indefatigable. Even now there are attempts to legislate that the pseudo science of Intelligent Design must be taught in school systems as a “debate” with Evolution. In common sense terms, that debate was over a century ago. Yet there are votes out there for politicians who support such legislation, and at the 2008 GOP presidential debate, no less that three candidates said they do not believe in evolution. I suppose I should be gratified that there weren’t more.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/12/new_agers_and_creationists_sho.html">New Agers and Creationists should not be President, December 2, 2009</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My only purpose today is to state early and often that if a Presidential candidate believes early humans used saddles to ride on the backs of dinosaurs, as they are depicted at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, that candidate should not be elected President.</p>

  <p>And if a candidate counts among close friends and advisors anyone in communication with the spirit world, that candidate should not be elected President.</p>

  <p>And if a candidate accounts for the fact that humanoid and dinosaur bones are never found at the same level in the fossil record by evoking the action of sediment after the Great Flood, that candidate should not be President.</p>

  <p>And if a candidate has a spirit guide, consults his or her Chart and takes more than a passing amusement in the horoscope, that candidate should not be elected President.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a category page linking these and other blogs, appropriately titled “<strong><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/darwin_my_hero/">Darwin My Hero</a></strong>”.</p>

<p>Comments about Roger Ebert are welcome.  Comments that are nonsequiters, religious rants, or are otherwise irrelevant, will be tossed onto the Bathroom Wall.</p>
