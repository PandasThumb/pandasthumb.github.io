  <p>According to <a href="http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/breakingnews/ci_22394460/judge-rules-jpls-favor-wrongful-termination-lawsuit">an article</a> in the Pasadena Star-News, Jet Propulsion Laboratory has finally won the <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/11/jpl-prevails-in.html">wrongful termination lawsuit</a> filed by David Coppedge. <a href="http://www.ncse.com">NCSE</a> has posted the judge’s decision <a href="http://ncse.com/files/20121130_Proposed-Statement-of-Decision.pdf"> here</a>. You may see an interpretation of the case <a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2013/01/17/final-decision-goes-against-coppedge/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Briefly, Coppedge was laid off in 2011 because he did not adequately learn a new system that JPL was adopting, but he argued in court that his dismissal was the result of religious discrimination. The Star-News quotes his lawyer as saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David was the victim of religious discrimination because a handful of malicious co-workers hated his Christian views, as well as his interest in intelligent design, which they ignorantly [sic] perceived to be a religious concept. He was demoted and fired for simply being a Christian and someone who believes that nature can be scientifically explained by reference to designs found within it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.lacanadaonline.com/news/tn-818-0117-judge-confirms-earlier-ruling-sides-with-jpl-in-intelligent-design-case,0,2898922.story">an article</a> in the La Cañada Valley Sun, however, JPL</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>argued Coppedge had a history of work-related complaints against him and that he was laid off for legitimate reasons at a time when the agency was shedding some 200 administrative jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The judge ruled against Coppedge on every claim and also ruled against every objection filed by his attorneys, according to the Sun.</p>
