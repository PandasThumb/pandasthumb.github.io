  <p>We are looking to expand our genomics faculty by hiring a comparative genomicist. Iâ€™ve been at ASU for a couple years and everything about it has impressed me. The facilities and faculty are world class. The administration is very supportive. The faculty are very collaborative. The teaching loads are reasonable. Finding amazing undergraduates is trivial. Etc. Anyway, if you are on the job market in genomics/bioinformatics/evolutionary medicine you should apply.</p>
