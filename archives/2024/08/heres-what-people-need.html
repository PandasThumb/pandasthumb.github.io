<p><i>The original title of this article, borrowed (as you may infer) from Ken Ham, was “Here’s What People NEED To Know about Ken Ham.” That title now seems too cute and did not seem to give the article much traction, so we have taken the unusual step of changing it to the present, more descriptive title. The URL remains the same. </i>
<br />
Ken Ham, on a YouTube video entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/1aGZoJCdCpo?si=8iLpBwawPiOYOYbE">Here’s What People NEED to Realize about Kamala Harris</a>” and specifically credited to Answers in Genesis, explicitly attacks Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris for her views on abortion and other matters. The video received around 150,000 views in a day or so. AIG writes,</p>

<blockquote><p>"In this short video, Ken Ham speaks on the recent political ideologies of Kamala, sharing his perspective on them as a Bible-believing Christian." [Note how he infantilizes her by using her first name only.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Our colleague Dan Phelps, who sent us this link, asks, “How is AIG, a ministry, still tax exempt?” He notes that AIG’s shell company, Ark Encounter, gets $1.825 million per year in sales tax rebates from Kentucky Tourism and is advertised for free by the taxpayer-supported “Kentucky Faith Trail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps suggests that you can complain to the IRS using <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf">Form 13909, Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint (Referral)</a>. It is not clear whether the IRS will take any action, but a few complaints cannot hurt. AIG’s street address is Answers in Genesis, 2800 Bullittsburg Church Rd., Petersburg, KY 41080, and their EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is 33-0596423.  You need to send a cover letter along with the form, but both may be e-mailed to the address at the bottom of page 1.</p>

<p>The IRS form asks you for “Who/What/Where/When/How you learned about and obtained the information in this report.” I do not know precisely what approach to take, beyond that Mr. Ham runs a tax-exempt religious organization, which he considers a ministry, and in this video he is implicitly campaigning against Kamala Harris. Perhaps this line of reasoning can be fleshed out in the comments to this post. The URL of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGZoJCdCpo.</p>

<p>In case you have the illusion that Mr. Ham is not electioneering, I can assure you that his minions think otherwise. Consider, for example, these (admittedly cherry-picked) comments:</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<blockquote><p>"We have had four years of warning. It’s time to vote her OUT!" </p>

<p>"Thanks Ken for being bold enough to say the truth about this election. Glory be to God in the Highest!" </p>

<p>"I can barely stand to listen to her. God help us all if she gets to be president." </p>

<p> "It’s time the we Christians vote politicians like this out of office and keep them out of our political arena.."</p>

<p>"I pray EVERY Christian goes out and votes this November. Pray and Vote. We cannot tolerate this evil any longer. Thank you AIG for making things so clear."</p> </blockquote>

<p>A majority of the comments merely pray for our lost souls and whatnot, but comments such as these clearly show that many, if not most, listeners recognize Mr. Ham’s true intention.</p>
