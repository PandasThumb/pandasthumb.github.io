<p>Yesterday, the 1st of August, is the 280th anniversary of the birth of Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine 
de Monet, who was the Chevalier de Lamarck.  As I have noted each year here, he was, 
as far as I am concerned, the first evolutionary biologist.  He had a (wrong) mechanism 
that would explain adaptation, and was the major pioneer in drawing evolutionary 
trees.  He was also a pioneer of invertebrate biology.  (Although he made use of 
inheritance of acquired characters in his mechanisms, he did not invent that idea, 
as most folks already believed that).</p>

<p>This time I want to note the way Lamarck is comemmorated in the name of a street 
in Paris, the Rue de Lamarck.  His name is also on streets in some other French cities. 
The explanation that I have heard of why that particular street was named after him 
is that it was being built about the time that Darwin was becoming famous, and the 
French found a then-almost-forgotten French biologist to commemmorate, to compete with 
Darwin.  So they named a street for him in an area where new streets were being built and named.  I don’t know whether this is really an accurate explanation.</p>

<p>The Rue de Lamarck is famous in Paris today as it gives its name to a major Metro 
stop, Lamarck-Coulaincourt.  Above you will see the very dramatic entrance to 
that Metro station, photographed from the Rue de Lamarck.  The entrance is between 
two stairways.</p>

<p>Happy 280th, Jean-Baptiste!</p>
