<p><b>UPDATE, Dec. 22: I have now listed 52 separate events I found, including links and quotes of the summaries where available. Please contribute more in the comments!</b></p>

<p>Merry Kitzmas to all!  Today is the 19th anniversary of the <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</i> trial, aka the Dover Panda Trial, held from September-November 2005, and decided on December 20, 2005.</p>

<p>Next year, 2025, will be the 20th anniversary of Kitzmiller, as well as the 100th anniversary of <i>Tennessee v. Scopes</i>, aka the Scopes Monkey Trial.</p>

<p>Stuck as I am, in Australia/New Zealand with 3 little kids, I expect I will have to follow events from afar.  But I will use this thread to accumulate links &amp; dates for relevant events as they come up. And please contribute ones you come across!</p>

<p>I expect that many are glum about current politics and science, but I recall a similar feeling in 2004, and that <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> was one of the early signs that committed citizens could move events in a pro-science direction. May 2025 be another such time!</p>

<p>Summaries of events are posted below, with abstracts where available:</p>

International Society for Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health<br />
Vanderbilt University, July 8-10, 2025<br />
<br />
<br />
The weekend following the ISEMPH conference (7/12/25 – 7/13/25), we will host an academic symposium featuring dozens of wonderful guest speakers from around the world. This event is sponsored in part by the National Center for Science Education. Leading experts (Ed Larson, Randy Moore, and Adam Laats) on all things Scopes will speak about the history of the trial. Next, we’ll hear about issues facing teachers today as they try to navigate teaching evolution (Barbara Forrest, Kenneth Miller, Amanda Townley). Then, we will hear from folks at the forefront of their evolution-focused fields about their research (Sean Carroll, Jonathan Losos, Marlene Zuk, Stephen Brusatte, and Briana Pobiner). We’ll finish off Day 1 with a roundtable discussion on evolutionary science in the 21st century.<br />
<br />
Day 2 will kick off with evolutionary research in fields other than biology, such as medicine (Paul Turner), agriculture (Sophien Kamoun), and the law (Owen Jones). After that, we’ll have another section on teaching evolution in a broader sense (Gale Sinatra, Patricia Hawley, Corrie Moreau, Riley Black, and Joseph Graves, Jr.). Our last proper session will be on the relationship of evolution and religion (Jamie Jensen, Katy Hinman, Liz Barnes and Lee Meadows). We’ll end with a second roundtable discussion on the future of evolution education.

<p><b>The Scopes Trial Centennial at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville</b></p>

<blockquote><div style="background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;"><br />
Scopes Trial Centennial Celebration<br />
<br />
<a href="https://artsci.utk.edu/scopes-trial-centennial-celebration/">https://artsci.utk.edu/scopes-trial-centennial-celebration/</a><br />
<br />
The Scopes Trial Centennial at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is a year-long program that marks the 100th anniversary of the July 1925 trial of John Thomas Scopes. As a high-school teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, Scopes was accused of violating the state’s Butler Act, which made it illegal to teach human evolution in any public school or university.<br />
<br />
The trial generated intense national publicity, as reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the high-profile lawyers facing each other in court. William Jennings Bryan, a three-time presidential candidate and former secretary of state, argued for the prosecution against ACLU lawyer Clarence Darrow, who served as the defense attorney for Scopes. The trial reflected a tension between religious fundamentalists and modern science that persists in America today.<br />
<br />
The Scopes Trial Centennial program will include Clarence Brown Theatre’s production of Inherit the Wind (February 14–March 2, 2025), which portrays a fictionalized version of the trial.<br />
<br />
The program will also showcase the university’s annual Darwin Day, hosted by the McClung Museum on a Sunday afternoon the week of Darwin’s birthday in early February.<br />
<br />
Throughout the year, a rich variety of speakers and exhibitions are being planned to address issues related to religion and science, American history, evolution, eugenics, journalism, law, and related topics. Additional programming is being developed that will be included as it is finalized.<br />
<br />
The Scopes Trial Centennial is organized by the UT College of Arts and Sciences (involving all three divisions) in collaboration with the College of Law, UT Libraries, the Institute for American Civics, Phi Beta Kappa Epsilon of Tennessee, and the Knoxville History Project.<br />
<br />
Historical images are from the public domain, originally taken by the Associated Press in 1925.<br />

<br />
The 1925 Scopes “Monkey” Trial often stands as a classic case demonstrating a fundamental conflict between religious and scientific worldviews. However, such characterizations mask the deeper complexities involved both in the trial and other historical engagements between religious and scientific perspectives. This panel brings together four scholars of religious studies to discuss how academic approaches to religion, culture, science, and media help move beyond the conflict thesis, demonstrating avenues for collaboration and understanding between diverse stakeholders as the 21st century progresses.<br />
<br />
Panel Participants: <br />
<br />
Dr. Joseph Witt: Associate Professor of Religious Studies, focusing on Religion, the Natural World, and Appalachia<br />
<br />
Dr. David Kline: Senior Lecturer of Religious Studies, focusing on Religion, Media, and Political and Contextual Christian Thought<br />
<br />
Dr. Megan Bryson: Associate Professor of Religious Studies, focusing on Asian Religions and Scientific Discourse<br />
<br />
Dr. Erin Darby: Associate Professor of Religious Studies, focusing on Judaism and the interpretation of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament<br />

The Scopes Trial in History and Folklore<br />
<br />
Edward Larson<br />
<br />
<b>Event description</b><br />
<br />
A century ago in Dayton, Tennessee, sensation-loving journalists of the 1920s transformed a small-town misdemeanor trial, brought under a new state law against teaching the theory of evolution in public schools, into a legendary clash of worldviews pitting populist orator, politician William Jennings Bryan and libertarian secularist, attorney Clarence Darrow. Over the ensuing years, fact and fiction blurred into the mythical version of the Tennessee Monkey Trial celebrated in bestselling books, Broadway plays, and Hollywood movies. In his lecture, Pulitzer Prize winning historian Edward Larson separates history from folklore in relating the story of the Scopes trial then and thereafter.<br />
<br />
Ed Larson holds the Darling Chair in Law and is a University Professor of History at Pepperdine University. Recipient of the 1998 Pulitzer Prize in History, Larson served as Associate Counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives and taught for twenty years at the University of Georgia, where he chaired the history department. The author of fifteen books and over eighty published articles, his books include A Magnificent Catastrophe: The Tumultuous Election of 1800; Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory; the Pulitzer Prize winning Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion, and the New York Times bestsellers, The Return of George Washington, 1783-1789 and Franklin &amp; Washington: The Founding Partnership. Larson recently published, American Inheritance: Liberty and Slavery in the Birth of a Nation, 1765-1795. Larson has served as a visiting professor at Yale Law School, Stanford Law School, the University of Melbourne, Leiden University, and the University of Richmond.

2025 Milton Klein Lecture Series<br />
<br />
with speaker Matt Sutton, Edward R. Meyer Distinguished Professor of History at Washington State University<br />
<br />
In recent years, evangelicals have become the largest and most powerful multi-issue interest group in the Republican Party. Historians have long focused on the Scopes Trial as the start of evangelical political engagement, setting the trajectory that runs through the 2024 presidential campaign. Sutton will argue that Scopes marked an important turning point, but not necessarily for the reasons we usually think.<br />
<br />
Matthew Avery Sutton is the Berry Family Distinguished Professor in the Liberal Arts and the chair of the Department of History at Washington State University. His most recent book is Double Crossed: The Missionaries Who Spied for the United States During the Second World War (Basic Books, 2019). He is also the author of American Apocalypse: A History of Modern Evangelicalism (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2014), and Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America (Harvard University Press, 2007). He has written for the New York Times, Washington Post, and New Republic. In 2016 he was appointed a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow.<br />

<b>Event description</b><br />
<br />
Dr. Paul Lombardo, Regents’ Professor and Bobby Lee Cook Professor of Law at Georgia State University, is a noted historian of eugenics and compulsory sterilization laws in the United States. He will be speaking on the role that eugenics played in the Scopes "Monkey" Trial. <br />
<br />
The “Monkey Trial” Centennial provides an opportunity to examine the widespread misunderstanding about how ideas of evolution and eugenics were implicated in the famous Scopes controversy.  George William Hunter’s textbook Civic Biology was the focus of the case. It endorsed evolution, a theory “that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible” -- content prohibited by a 1925 Tennessee law. <br />
<br />
The Hunter text also contained a chapter on eugenics. In recent years an elaborate mythology has arisen suggesting that the case, and William Jennings Bryan’s advocacy at trial, represented a challenge to eugenics. That claim is demonstrably false. The teaching of eugenics in its many forms was supported not only by educators, but also by members of the clergy and politicians all across the United States. That support was evident before the Scopes case and continued for decades afterwards, persisting even in full awareness of the Nazi government program that sterilized almost 1/2 million Germans.<br />
<br />
This talk will explain that while William Jennings Bryan rejected the monkey- to-man account of evolution and the cruelties he associated with Darwinian “natural selection,” he made no blanket condemnation of eugenics. To the contrary, Bryan and his wife readily allied themselves with several famous eugenists and supported eugenic ideology when it coincided with the social policies they favored.  <br />

<p><b><a href="https://www.scopes100.com/">Scopes Trial Centennial 2025</a>
March-July 2025, Dayton, Tennessee<br /></b></p>

<p>Dayton, Tennessee, back to and including 1925, has promoted the town and the region as the site of the famous Scopes Monkey Trial, the (first) “Trial of the Century”.</p>

<p>For the 100th, they do not disappoint, with a variety of events ranging from scholarly to artistic and stage, and including even a Strawberry Festival.  Naturally, some of this involves fundamentalist Bryan College in Dayton, which itself traces right back to the Scopes Trial and William Jennings Bryan, so your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>However, having attended some similar events in 2014-2015, I expect many of these are worth going to.  In 2014 or 2015 I went to a stage production called something like “Our Story”, which was in a sense about the Scopes Trial, but more about the perspective of the locals, which they felt had been left out with the usual discussion of the huge science/religion issues.</p>

<br />
BUY TICKETS<br />
<br />
In 1925, the legal question debated during the Scopes Trial was whether John Scopes broke the law by teaching the Darwinian theory of human origins. But lawyers also debated questions which still are at the center of public discussion today: Parental rights in public education, can the majority impose its will on the minority, academic freedom (of teachers and students), the role of religion in public life. Hotly debated then, still capable of raising temperatures today, these questions were not settled in 1925 – and probably won’t be settled during this discussion.<br />
<br />
In 1925, both sides had their say; in this symposium you will hear more than one viewpoint presented by experts in their disciplines, and you will have an opportunity to interact with the presenters.<br />
<br />
The program begins promptly at 9 a.m. Wednesday and Thursday, July 16 and 17, in the Scopes Trial courtroom of the historic Rhea County Courthouse.<br />
<br />
Dr. Nick Spencer will lead off with a presentation on “Science, Religion and How We Got Here;” followed by Attorney Jerry Summers, speaking on “The Trial and Its People.” After a break for lunch, Dr. Edward Larson, recipient of the Pulitzer Prize in History for his book “Summer for the Gods,” will speak on the legacy of the trial in American life. Following Dr. Larson’s program, the afternoon will be open for tours of historic sites in and near Dayton.<br />
<br />
On Thursday, Dr. Neal Doran will discuss ”Science at the Scopes Trial and Since;” and Dr. John Hawks will present his findings on “Human Origins: What Paleontology Tells Us.” After lunch, Dr. Joel Duff will speak on “Christians and Evolution after the Trial,” and Dr. Todd Wood and Mr. Paul Garner will discuss “A History of Creationism and the Future of the Creation/Evolution Debate.” Free time will be available for tours Thursday afternoon.<br />
<br />
There will be breaks between sessions and for lunch both days. A study guide will be provided for your further reflection on the presentations.<br />

The congregation and the minister disagreed about hearing a sermon on evolution – and we’ll tell the rest of the story when you get here!<br />
<br />
After a hearty meal, serenaded by music from the era, Dr. Randy Moore, author of the recently published John Thomas Scopes: A Biography, will speak on “John Scopes: The Rest of the Story.” After you hear his talk, you definitely will want to read the book.<br />
