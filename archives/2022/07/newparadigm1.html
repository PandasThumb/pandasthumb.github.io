<p>Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can 
be a regular feature.  I figure that once a month is about 
right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to
supply it.  Well, actually I actually hope that there will be no
need for such a series, but alas …</p>

<p>This month we report on two such events:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused
chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds.  An 
article in <em>The New Yorker</em> suggests that this may discredit
the very notion of a phylogeny.  That in turn has led to comments
by many of the usual suspects.  One of the major scientific papers on
bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman, who has not been shy about commenting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared
in <em>The Guardian</em>.  Its author called for existing
evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced
by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis.  The piece has been welcomed by creationists and
advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“Below the fold” you will find some more details and links.  Will
the new paradigms still be around a month from now?</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<h4 id="the-hoatzin-disproves-the-tree">The hoatzin disproves the tree</h4>

<p>The hoatzin, which looks like an exasperated chicken, seems to
have diverged from other birds early in the radiation of modern
birds.  The branches in the tree of life connecting it to their
ancestors are short, and long ago.  That is the situation in which 
we expect it to be difficult to place the hoatzin branch. But an
article in <em>The New Yorker</em> by Ben Crair
on July 15, 2022 comes
to a much more dramatic conclusion 
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-bizarre-bird-thats-breaking-the-tree-of-life">(you can find it here, perhaps behind a paywall)</a>.
The hoatzin “is breaking the
tree of life”.  He mentions a number of phenomena, such as
discrepancies between “gene trees” (coalescents) and species
trees, as reasons that the genealogy of the hoatzin calls
into question the notion of phylogeny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Darwin thought family trees could explain evolution. The hoatzin suggets otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crair’s dramatic piece has been noticed and commented on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jerry Coyne, at his site Why Evolution Is True <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/17/the-new-yorker-writes-about-the-hoatzin-implies-that-darwns-idea-of-evolutionary-trees-may-be-a-phantom/">is upset at the New Yorker article</a></li>
  <li>The Discovery Institute’s “Evolution News” reporter David Klinghoffer <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/bizarre-bird-highlights-the-problem-of-biogeography/">reacts to Jerry’s article</a>.  It is less clear
whether Klinghofer would accept any genealogical scheme for the
relationships of living organisms.</li>
  <li>Here, in the thread on the previous thread on the photo of
the Greater Yellowlegs <em>Tringa melanoleuca</em> there was
<a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca.html">some discussion of the <em>New Yorker</em> piece</a> 
in the comments, after the troll “Data” linked to it there.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goodbye-to-the-evolutionary-synthesis-too">Goodbye to the evolutionary synthesis too</h4>

<p>If the hoatzin piece were not enough, the past month also saw
a piece in <em>The Guardian</em> casually toss out the Modern
Synthesis.  Stephen Buranyi wrote
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/28/do-we-need-a-new-theory-of-evolution">a deliberately provocate “long read” article</a>
entitled “Do we need a new theory of evolution?”  His 
subheading text is more provocative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A new wave of scientists argues that mainstream evolutionary theory needs an urgent overhaul. Their opponents have dismissed them as misguided careerists – and the conflict may determine the future of biology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the article promotes the views that their advocates have
labelled the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.  The EES was first
put forward by a group who have been called The Altenberg 16, who
met in 2008 in a meeting in Altenberg, Austria.  The meeting was
greeted with great joy by the Discovery Institute, and journalist 
Susan Mazur wrote a whole book about it: <em>The Altenberg 16: An
exposé of the evolution industry</em>, which she published
<em>before the meeting had taken place</em>.  It was followed in 2016
by a meeting on <em>New trends in evolutionary biology: biological,
philosophical, and social science perspectives</em> sponsored by the Royal Society,
and involving some of the same people (though many of the
evolutionary biologists in the Royal Society were unhappy
about its endorsement of these views).  There has been much blog
traffic about these meetings.</p>

<p>Buranyi discusses many of the phenomena invoked by the
EES.  It is obvious that his suggested answer is “yes”,
in violation of Betteridge’s Law of Headlines.  There have
been many reactions to Buranyi’s article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evolutionary biologists Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth
and Jerry Coyne <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/05/evolutionary-biologists-are-ever-adapting-to-progress-in-science">wrote a reply in the Guardian</a> expressing
their disagreement wth the article, concluding that it
“gives a misleading picture of contemporary evolutonary.
biology”</li>
  <li><a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/06/our-rejected-letters-to-the-guardian-about-evolution/">At his site Why Evolution Is True</a>, Jerry Coyne
republished their article, also a letter by
evolutionary bilogist Doug Futuyma that the Guardian
declined to publish, as well as a list of errors in
Buranyi’s article that Brian Charlesworth compiled.  In
addition he describes three other replies that the
Guardian did publish, which he is not impressed by.</li>
  <li>At Larry Moran’s important blog Sandwalk, <a href="https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2022/07/do-we-need-new-theory-of-evolution.html">he
posted on the Guardian article</a>. His
view is that the current theory should be called Modern Evolutionary
Biology, and he is not happy with the EES folks.  He says
that Buranyi’s article is pretty good, if you ignore
its “unfortunate” first four paragraphs, which he quotes.
Some Panda’s Thumb regulars are among the commenters on Larry’s
arcle.</li>
  <li>P. Z. Myers discussed the Buranyi article at some length
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/06/28/not-impressed-by-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/">at his blog, Pharyngula</a> in a post
entitled “Not impressed by the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis”.  He
and Jerry Coyne are in more agreement on that than either would
like to admit.</li>
  <li>Of course, Evolution News needed to have its say,
which it did more than once, in articles <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/donate-darwinism-for-a-tax-credit-evolutionists-admit-their-fields-failures/">by David Klinghoffer</a>
(“evolutionists admit thei field’s failures …. full of scandalous admissions”), by</li>
  <li>… and <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/darwin-and-the-ghost-of-lamarck/">a mention</a> in an article by philology, lterature, and
philosophy professor Neil Thomas about Darwin and Lamarck.</li>
  <li>I have previously posted <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/uncommon-diversion.html">here at PT</a> on Uncommon
Descent’s invocation of Buranyi’s article when looking
forward to pro-ID rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.</li>
  <li>Cue creationist David Coppedge <a href="https://crev.info/2022/07/darwin-sausage-factory-exposed/">at Creation/Evolution Headlines</a>.  The title, “Darwin Sausage Factory Exposed” and the summary “A look inside the sausage factory where Darwinism
is manufactured could leave a visitor retching” says all.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my obviously-biased view, evolutionary biology has
already assimilated many of these phenomena, so that the
discussion is really just about whether or not to rename
the theory.  Renaming has the disadvantage that it may lead
most people to assume that the evolutionary processes that
they learned about in school, including mutation, natural
selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, have been discarded.
(The EES folks would say that the phenomena that they invoke
are not being paid enough attention, and so a renaming is
needed).</p>

<p>We await with eagerness next month’s new paradigm.</p>
