<p></p>
<p>It is interesting that, as of Wednesday (July 13) late afternoon, that Answers 
in Genesis has posted nothing about the spectacular preliminary results from the James Webb 
Space Telescope (JWST) released the previous day. Most people probably missed it, but AiG 
has responded in a very poor way, on their Facebook and possibly other social media. On 
Tuesday, July 12 on AiG’s and Ken Ham’s Facebook pages, there was a simulcast of the NASA 
press conference where the first photos and results from the JWST were shown. Here is the link to the Ham Facebook post of the simulcast video: 
﻿<a href="https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl">https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl</a>.
I don’t know if you have to have a Facebook account to view this.  (It is also available on Youtube
<a href="https://youtu.be/od6829WF-S4">here</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Their response was by AiG’s astronomer, Dr. Danny Faulkner, and their “rocket scientist,” Rob 
Webb. Their discussion was a rather weak critique of the JWST’s findings and funny and sad at the same 
time. Through most of their simulcast, one couldn’t hear what the NASA people were saying, but this 
may have been a technical difficulty. About 23 minutes in Dr. Faulkner and Webb bizarrely claim that 
light year distances don’t necessarily equal long time scales (thus not refuting a 6,000 year old 
universe). Soon after, Dr. Faulkner states his “theory” (not a scientific theory, but he doesn’t seem 
to know this) that we can see things billions of light years away in a 6,000 year old universe because 
of a “miracle.” His position is literally “then a miracle occurred.” This is reminiscent of the famous 
Sidney Harris cartoon found here: <a href="http://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/gallery.php">here</a>. Dr. Faulkner 
goes on to say that Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden saw pretty much what we see today when 
looking at the night sky.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>Most of the rest of the simulcast consisted of preaching, and mocking NASA by ascribing the scientific 
views of NASA (and basically all of science) as “naturalistic worldview” and “assumptions” while 
touting their un-scientific use of “Biblical glasses.” At one point Dr. Faulkner would sip a drink of 
Cheerwine cherry cola every time he thought “naturalistic assumptions” were mentioned by 
NASA. Interestingly, Faulkner is skeptical that stars are forming today in spite of an incredible 
amount of information that has been around for decades,  plus the spectacular visual of the Eta Carina 
Nebulae just provided by the JWST. Perhaps his standard of evidence is considerably different from 
mainstream astronomers. One suspects no amount of evidence could change their views. After all, 
both Dr. Faulkner and Webb have signed AiG’s “Statement of Faith” found 
here ( https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/). One clause even posits, as a requirement for AiG employment, that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information (Numbers 23:19; 2 Samuel 22:31; Psalm 18:30; Isaiah 46:9–10, 55:9; Romans 3:4; 2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Faulkner advertised one of his books available from AiG near the end of the broadcast. Then AiG’s 
simulcast ended with more preaching by Faulkner and Webb, imploring us to not trust 
the “shifting sands of Man’s opinions” and reminding us that AiG, the Ark, and Creation Museum 
are “all about the Gospel.”</p>

<p>I can’t believe I sat through the entire simulcast. I want that time back!  As mentioned, it was 
unintentionally funny and sad, but still an enormous waste of time. The creationist’s bizarre views 
are ignored by science, but are held by millions of voters. I wouldn’t have endured this, but AiG and 
its followers have an inordinate influence on science education in Kentucky and elsewhere and 
the Ark is still receiving a $1.825 million per year sales tax incentive rebate from Kentucky 
Tourism. AiG has support from numerous Kentucky politicians and counts two candidates for 
Governor (Attorney General Daniel Cameron and State Representative Savannah Maddox), and perhaps 
more, as supporters.</p>
