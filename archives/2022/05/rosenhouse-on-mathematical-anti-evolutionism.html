<p>
  Jason Rosenhouse, <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>.  Cambridge
University Press, 2022.
<p>

Written by a mathematician who has paid close attention to mathematical arguments
against evolution, this is a beautifully written and careful refutation of
those arguments.  Actually, that sentence I plagiarized from the back cover
of this book.  But I don't have to worry about having done that, since it
comes from a blurb written by me.  I also gave Jason Rosenhouse comments on the
manuscript.
<p>
Jason Rosenhouse is a professor of mathematics at James Madison University
who also writes popularizations of his field, including a book on the
mathematics of Sudoku and one on the Monty Hall Problem (you know:
the one with the doors and the goats).  Is he overreaching by taking on
creationist and ID arguments?  Hardly: he has written extensively
on this, including many posts here in PT starting in its first year. For a while had his own
blog called EvolutionBlog.  He attended creationist and ID conferences
and wrote about that experience in his 2012 book, <em>Among the Creationists. Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line</em>.
<p>
This is a lovely and fascinating book which covers the most
widely-cited mathematical arguments against evolution, explaining them and
their weaknesses lucidly for a general audience.  If you are not
writing a review for one of the Discovery Institute sites, you
will be impressed.
<p>
Let me outline the chapters, to give you a general picture of what
is covered ...
<p>
<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>
<p>
Here are the chapters and some indication of their contents:
<p>
1. Scientists and Their Hecklers.  Outlines the types of
critics and the way they operate, and explains why
mathematics gets involved.
<p>
2. Evolution Basics.  Outlines evolutionary theory, and
introduces the arguments from complex structures,
unbridgeable gaps, and irreducible complexity.  Plus
a section on "Paying A Price for Being Wrong".
<p>
3. The Parallel Tracks of Mathematical Reasoning. Explains
how mathematical modeling and logical proof interact
in explaining natural phenomena, and why arguments such
as the rareness of well-adapted organisms in a genotype
space don't work.
<p>
4. The Legacy of the Wistar Conference.  Using the
1966 conference called by some mathematical critics
of evolutionary biology, explains why their critiques
were refuted, and how present-day creationists
misrepresent what was said at that conference.
<p>
5. Probability Theory.  Examples from cards and from
the Hardy-Weinberg calculation in population genetics
lead to a consideration of the argument from
improbability, and its use in William Dembski's
argument from Complex Specified Information and
Michael Behe's argument about the Edge of Evolution.
<p>
6. Information and Combinatorial Search.  Information
theory, claims that random mutations always decrease
the information content of biological systems.
Protein space.  Dawkins' Weasel. The No Free Lunch Theorem.
Artifical life. Dembski and Marks's Conservation
of Information, and fine tuning of the universe.
<p>
7. Thermodynamics. Entropy, thermodynamic laws, and
statistical mechanics. Arguments from entropy and
statistical mechanics.  Henry Morris's Second Law
argument. Granville Sewell's revived Second Law
argument.
<p>
8. Epilogue.  Bad math can be rhetorically
effective.  Can human intelligence build
complex adaptations?
<p>
In addition, each chapter ends with Notes
and Further Reading, typically 2-3 pages
of notes, each with a one or more references
for further reading.
<p>
In short, this is a treasure.  Is it perfect?
Of course not.  As someone who, like most of
us, thinks visually, I would have liked to see
more figures.  The argument fom fine-tuning
is hammered into the ground at a bit more
length than necessary.  The cover design is
lovely, but I don't know what it symbolizes.
And computers have not "been used to
simulate evolution since the late 1960s", but
actually since the mid-1950s.
<p>
Jason Rosenhouse's book will be cited frequently
in future arguments about mathematical
dismissals of evolution.  And should be.
