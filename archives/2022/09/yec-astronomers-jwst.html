<p>Young Earth Creationist (YEC) astronomers have declared victory for creationism because of the findings of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our favorite YEC astronomers have finally discussed the JWST at length. On Wednesday, September 14, 2022, on Facebook Dr. Danny Faulkner and Rob Webb of AiG, and Dr. Jason Lisle (formerly of AiG, now at the Biblical Science Institute) discuss the early findings of the JWST for <a href="https://fb.watch/fymizG2T2H/">a full excruciating hour</a>.</p>

<p>Faulkner and Lisle have PhDs in astronomy. Rob Webb recently was hired by AiG as a preacher/scientist and has experience in aerospace engineering, helping design several different spacecraft (hence his AiG nickname “Rocket Rob”).  Their “discussion” consists mostly of self-congratulation and sundry claims that every new finding supports Young Earth Creationism including having light from galaxies billions of light years away getting to Earth in a mere 6,000 years (a miracle!). Their self congratulations are based on the fact that astronomers are revising their ideas about how quickly galaxies and heavy elements formed in the early universe because of new data from JWST findings. This motley crew seems to be gloating that other astronomers are – gasp! – doing science. Much of the rest of the video is preaching/scripture quoting and, at about 23 minutes in, claiming a nefarious conspiracy of morally questionable “secular astronomers” based on their “worldview.” Most astronomers I know are upright citizens.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>About 32 minutes in, Drs. Lisle and Faulkner joke about dead Democrats voting in Chicago, and Dr. Lisle claims “dead people vote Left.”</p>

<p>In Dr. Faulkner’s esteemed scientific opinion God created life only on earth, not elsewhere (~36 minutes in). However, he intones, this only includes “physical life like us; I’m not talking about spirit beings like angels and demons, and so forth.” (Is this video from the 13th century?) Then, after a discussion of exoplanets, Dr. Faulkner also tells us that God will destroy stars and galaxies when he creates a “new heavens and a new Earth” (~39 minutes). Golly wow! Thankfully, Dr. Faulkner goes on to rebuff an online questioner who asks about the flat earth, giving Biblical and scientific reasons the ancient Bible-based cosmology is wrong. Dr. Faulkner has even written a thick tome about the subject (for sale at the Creation Museum and Ark Park, as well as online). The three gentlemen then discuss flat earth theory and the psychology of the cultish behavior behind it for a bit. They appear oblivious to the irony, that, in spite of their education, they are promoting a 6,000 year old universe and Earth. When they agreed that it is a “psychological issue,” I stopped the video for a few minutes out of necessity. I couldn’t decide to laugh or cry, so I took a bathroom break.</p>

<p>Near the end (~53 minutes) Dr. Lisle bemoans that mainstream science is ignoring his claim that he predicted the findings of the JWST. He goes on to claim that science itself wouldn’t be possible if the Bible weren’t true. Lisle then posts the inane cartoon in the frontispiece (my screenshot) insulting scientists and intelligent people as well as confusing evolution and cosmology/cosmogony.</p>

<p>The video ends with mentions of books for sale and touts the Creation Museum planetarium.</p>
