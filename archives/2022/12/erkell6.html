<h2 id="breakthrough-for-intelligent-design-part-6">Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 6)</h2>

<p>November 13, 2020</p>

<p>by Lars Johan Erkell</p>

<p><strong>Why was this article written?</strong></p>

<p>As I hope has become clear, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article does not
meet the requirements that one reasonably could expect from a scientific
publication. It pretends to have results that do not exist. The article
relies entirely on a statistical method to demonstrate designs that is
useless. It contains references to an indeterminate supernatural designer
that is resorted to <em>ad hoc</em> to achieve desired results. It introduces the
completely revolutionary concept of "non-physical information" without
definition or discussion. It contains a grossly garbled quote. In
addition, well-known pseudoscientific concepts such as "irreducible
complexity" and "specified complexity" are referred to as if they were
established science. This cannot be called science. It can only be called
pseudoscience.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>Of course, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have received criticism. Three biologists write in a comment to the Journal of Theoretical Biology, among other things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… The central claim of this paper is that because biological systems are complex then they must be fine-tuned. This inference is flawed and is not supported by the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nor is the mathematician Jason Rosenhaus gracious in his criticism. He concludes thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… The authors claim to have used probability theory to establish a scientifically rigorous and useful notion of “fine-tuning,” but they have failed because we have nothing like the information we would need to carry out meaningful probability calculations. Done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I don’t think I’ve adequately communicated just how bad this paper is. The authors are constantly tossing out bits of mathematical jargon and notation, but then they do nothing with them. There is a frustrating lack of precision, as when they variously describe fine-tuning as an object, an entity, a method, and an attribute of a system, all on the first page of the paper. They constantly cite creationist references, with only the most glancing mention that any of this work has been strongly and cogently criticized. They say we should give fair consideration to a “design model” for the origin of complex structures, but they do not give the beginning of a clue as to what such a model entails.</p>

<p>In short, it’s hard to believe this paper could have gotten through an honest peer-review process (as opposed to one in which ideology played a big role). Whatever happened behind the scenes, it’s a huge black eye for the journal.</p>

<p>The review is worth reading in its entirety. It also covers things I didn’t cover here.</p>

<div align="center">***</div>

<p>Steinar Thorvaldsen is Professor of Information Science at Norway's
Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is Professor of Mathematical
Statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors
at reputable universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would
write papers of this poor quality in their own fields (I also doubt they
would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As
experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of
the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk
name and reputation to write an article that makes me and many colleagues
facepalm and wonder what has gotten into the authors? This is not
something you expect from a professor at a respected university.</p>

<p>My guess is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism that characterizes established natural science. The idea of “Intelligent Design” as an alternative, non-materialistic science was launched in the USA in the 1990s by the conservative Christian think tank Discovery Institute. The institute’s agenda was revealed in 1999 when the policy document The Wedge Document was leaked and posted on the Internet. It appears that they see “materialism” and moral relativism as the cause of all evil in society. Materialism must therefore be crushed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Discovery Institute’s Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An important part of materialism is today’s natural science, and therefore is an overarching goal</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Design theory has been created to replace materialistic science:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document shows very clearly that the ID project is a
political/religious project; it is about working for a society that is
completely imbued with a Christian religiosity. A theocracy, in other
words. Natural science is "materialistic" and therefore stands in the
way. Therefore, it must be replaced by a religiously based design
science.<sup>1</sup> In case any reader should think that I am presenting conspiracy
theories, I would recommend a careful reading of the document.</p>

<p>This explains why ID continues to be pursued as a science even though the
project is completely sterile - in more than 20 years it has failed to
produce a single solid result that concretely demonstrates design in
nature. On the other hand, mountains of material have been produced that
criticize established natural science in general and the theory of
evolution in particular. The goal of the activity is not primarily to
convince the researchers; it is to convince the public and decision-
makers at various levels that design theory is better science than the
established, materialistic, natural science. The document shows that the
strategy is to defeat science in the political arena.</p>

<p>But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola
Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian
foundation BioCosmos, Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as
"ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread Intelligent Design, primarily to
youth and young adults, and is Norwegian partner of the Discovery
Institute. This article falls into the same pattern as countless other
pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is
a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many
arguments against the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a
crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists,
be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific, project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it is sad that two such competent and meritorious researchers are unable to live up to the scientific integrity one has the right to expect from them.</p>

<p><strong>Part 6: Why was the fine-tuning article written?</strong></p>

<p>In part 6, Erkell continues and asks what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to
write the article on fine-tuning. I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steinar Thorvaldsen is Professor of Information Science at Norway's
Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is Professor of Mathematical
Statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors
at reputable universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would
write papers of this poor quality in their own fields (I also doubt they
would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As
experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of
the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk

facepalm and wonder what has gotten into the authors? This is not
something you expect from a professor at a respected university. My guess
is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that
includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism
that characterizes established natural science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In parts 1-5 I responded to Erkell’s claims that TH2020 is a
pseudoscientific article of poor quality. Let me therefore answer
Erkell's question why I have been involved in writing this and other
articles with an ID-based or creationist focus. There are two main
reasons. Firstly, I have been part of the academic community since I
started studying university mathematics at the age of 15. This long
period taught me a lot about how (empirical) science should be conducted.
I advocate academic freedom, where all relevant theories are allowed to
take part and compete on equal footing in terms of providing the best
explanations of data, in the search for the truth. For more than 20
years, I have studied genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that
Darwin's theory of evolution contains crucial flaws that are rarely
mentioned, neither in school nor at universities. It is my duty as a
scientist (part of the third task) to engage in the public sphere and
spread the experiences that I have acquired, both from my own research
and by learning from the research of others. My conscience therefore
urges me to enter the evolution-design debate, and this is more important
than political correctness.</p>

<p>Second, all empirical science is based on faith assumptions. All attempts
to let only empirical data guide natural science (such as logical
positivism) have failed. These beliefs are especially important for
questions of origin, because we cannot replicate through repeated
experiments how life arose, or how the diversity of life between
different species came about. Therefore, every researcher who engages in
origin issues will be more or less guided by their starting assumptions
and beliefs. So am I. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and
Lord, at the age of 23-24, and over the years I have realized more and
more how trustworthy and reliable the Bible is. I am therefore convinced
that design-inspired or biblically inspired (and falsifiable) models
provide the best explanation for genetic, geological and morphological
data. But I don't want to force these explanations on others, but let the
ID and creationist models compete with secular models on equal terms.
With sadness in my heart I notice how methodological naturalism has
gradually narrowed (and forced) science into a secular direction ever
since the 18th century. This has to a large extent, driven development of
society in a materialistic direction. And the theory of evolution has had
a decisive role in this process, because it is the creation story of
naturalism, and thus influences many other sciences. If neither God nor
anything else supernatural exists, then everything must have arisen by
itself, just as the theory of evolution claims. This is precisely why it
is so sensitive to criticize the theory of evolution, of which Erkell's
article series is a typical example. To criticize the theory of evolution
is simply to question the foundations of a worldview that dominates a
secular culture.</p>

<p>After Erkell’s opening question about what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to
write the fine-tuning article, he goes on to discuss an American ID think
tank, the Discovery Institute, and its efforts to influence societal
development away from materialism. The reason is that both Thorvaldsen
and myself have been involved in a Norwegian think tank that is positive
about ID:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola
Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian
foundation BioCosmos, Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as
"ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread Intelligent Design, primarily to
youth and young adults, and is Norwegian partner of the Discovery
Institute. This article falls into the same pattern as countless other
pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is
a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many
arguments against the theory of evolution.</p>

  <p>Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a
crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists,
be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific,
project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already argued (in Parts 1-5) that ID and creationism are science, and
I will therefore not repeat my arguments in parts 1-5. I will content
myself by saying that I neither consider TH2020 to be an example of
pseudo-science or anti-science. But Erkell;s claims are not
surprising, since he very strongly advocates methodological naturalism,
that is, secular science. From Erkell's point of view, a crusade against
natural science is the same as a crusade against secular natural science.
As I have stressed in this series of articles, I believe that biblically
inspired models and design-inspired models very often have much better
explanatory power than the corresponding secular models. But since I
don’t want to force others to take this approach, it’s hardly a
crusade. One can rather ask the question whether Erkell is waging a
crusade against all science that does not start from methodological
naturalism.</p>

<p>In this post, I discuss the possible motivations of the article authors.
In your reply, you write: "For more than 20 years, I have studied
genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that Darwin's theory of
development contains crucial flaws that are rarely mentioned, neither in
school nor at university." From what you write, I suspect that you have
drawn your knowledge from creationist sources rather than from university
courses. The formulation of "crucial flaws rarely mentioned" is a classic
creationist theme. But there is no science that is complete or perfect;
there are gaps and "critical deficiencies" in all fields of science.
However, creationists are most interested in the flaws they see in
evolutionary biology. This fact that the flaws are "rarely mentioned" and
your talk of "political correctness" also connects to a well-known
creationist theme: the atheist scientists who completely dominate science
and try to stifle all opposition to the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>I believe you have misunderstood your duties as a scientist when it comes
to engagement in the public sphere. The university pays you to present 
the science and scientific view that the university stands for, not for
you to present a scientific view (and a view of evolutionary biology)
that the university does not stand for. As a researcher, you certainly
have a lot of freedom to choose different perspectives, but I think you
are probably crossing the line here.</p>

<p>You write that "It is with sadness in my heart that I see how
methodological naturalism has gradually narrowed (and forced) science
into a secular direction since the 18th century", and here I think we
have come to the heart of the matter. You see an ideological struggle
between two cultures, one secular and the other spiritual. I, on the
other hand, see a successful, secular, research program replacing a
sterile, spiritual, program. Materialistic research has gradually
replaced research on a non-materialistic basis because it actually works
and produces results. I have never seen any example of successful natural
science on a spiritual/religious basis.</p>

<p>But as I write in the seventh post in the series, I could imagine an ID-inspired 
research if it produced concrete results. But we are not there.
All you can offer are assurances that an ID-inspired research will open
up to new advances by freeing science from materialistic lock-ins.
However, I can't see any signs that this could be the case. I discuss
this further in the post <a href="2016-11-16-erkell8.md">"Science, hypotheses and Intelligent Design"</a>.</p>

<p>You avoid perhaps the most serious part of my criticism, namely that the
ID project is fundamentally not about science but is a
political/religious project aimed at building a society completely imbued
with Christian religiosity - a theocracy. Do you have any comment on
that?</p>
