  <p>Reporter James McNair recently <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-26546-creation_museum_atte.html">reported</a> in a Cincinnati newspaper that the attendance at the Creation Museum has dropped for four consecutive years and that Answers in Genesis lost over $500,000. These tidbits inspired my colleague Dan Phelps and me to look at AIG’s Forms 990. These are tax forms that must be submitted by nonprofit organizations to the US Internal Revenue Service and may be found if you have a (free) account on <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/">GuideStar</a>.</p>

<p>According to various Forms 990 through the tax year ending June 30, 2011, in four consecutive years, AIG has run surpluses of approximately $2.1 million, $716,000, and $940,000, and a loss of $540,000. Not exactly a monotonic decline, but certainly a steep drop from a surplus of $2.1 million to a loss of $540,000 in three years. Can we expect similar losses due to the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/noahs-ark-park.html">Ark Park</a>? Maybe:  Joe Sonka in the Louisville newspaper <a href="http://leoweekly.com/news/lost-kingdom">LeoWeekly</a> reports that “… correspondence between Ark Encounter and the Tourism Cabinet reveal an application process that proceeded with remarkable speed, little scrutiny, and standards that appear different from that of [another applicant].”</p>

<p>The 2010 Form 990 (for fiscal year ending June 30, 2011) has some interesting information.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The president of AIG, Ken Ham, earned an annual salary of approximately $150,000 and a total package of around $200,000, which I think is not out of line for the president of a company with approximately $20 million of revenue (Schedule J, Part II). Four of Ham’s children, his son-in-law, his brother, and his sister-in-law are listed as staff members, with annual salaries between approximately $1300 and nearly $80,000 (Schedule L, Part IV).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AIG says that <a href="http://arkencounter.com/faq/">Crosswater Canyon, a nonprofit, will operate AIG’s Ark Park</a> but that a limited-liability company will own it. Crosswater Canyon is identified in Schedule R as being wholly controlled by AIG; we assume that means it is a subsidiary. According to Whois, <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/crosswatercanyon.org">crosswatercanyon.org</a> is one of approximately 1300 domain names owned by AIG, but crosswatercanyon.org, .com, and .net yield nothing useful.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Crosswater Canyon reimbursed AIG a bit over $1 million for expenses. The Ark Park was formally announced in December, 2010. The payment was made some time between then and June 30, 2011. AIG was thus reimbursed $1 million for expenses within six or seven months of the announcement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule R, Part III, lists Takenbac Enterprises, LLC, PO Box 384, Hebron, KY 41048 as a “related organization taxable as a partnership.” Two of the officers of <a href="https://app.sos.ky.gov/ftshow/%28S%28cnhiqthmwark0zvxj1bab43s%29%29/default.aspx?path=ftsearch&amp;id=0629176&amp;ct=06&amp;cs=99999">Takenbac Enterprises </a> are “key employees” of AIG and draw annual salaries of approximately $90,000 from AIG. We speculate that Takenbac is the mysterious “private Limited Liability Company (LLC) [that] will own the Ark Encounter,” according to AIG’s <a href="http://arkencounter.com/faq/">FAQ’s</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Geo-Research Pty., Ltd. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_company">proprietary company</a>], 27 Rising St., Shailer Park, Queensland, Australia, received $128,000 for consulting (Part VII).  Geo-Research is or was the <a href="www.icr.org/i/pdf/research/AGUC-14_Poster_Baumgardner.pdf">employer of Andrew Snelling</a>, a former geologist who <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/events/bio.aspx?Speaker_ID=69">joined the staff of AIG in 2007</a>. The <a href="http://www.homehound.com.au/27+rising+street+shailer+park+qld+4128/">address of Geo-Research</a> appears to be a private home that has been for sale but is now off the market.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps readers can fill in some of the blanks.</p>
