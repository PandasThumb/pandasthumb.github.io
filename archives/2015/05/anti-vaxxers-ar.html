  <p>“Measles vaccine protects against other deadly diseases,” proclaims an <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/05/measles-vaccine-protects-against-other-deadly-diseases">article</a> in ScienceInsider. In reality, the protection is indirect: Getting measles disposes you to getting other potentially fatal diseases over the next several years. Evidently, measles, unlike, for example, whooping cough, not only weakens your immune system but also makes it “forget,” so you may even contract a disease that you already had and thought you were immune to. (As an aside, though it was supposedly impossible, I contracted mumps twice, as diagnosed both times by a physician. I now wonder whether I had contracted measles between the two cases of mumps.)</p>

<p>As described in the ScienceInsider article, Michael Mina and colleagues at the Emory University School of Medicine <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6235/694.full">demonstrated a correlation</a> between a child’s getting measles and subsequently dying of other diseases. Specifically, they showed that children who survive measles are especially vulnerable to contracting a fatal illness for an average of approximately 2.5 years after the measles infection. The result held true both before and after the widespread use of the measles vaccine. The researchers found no such vulnerability among children who had contracted whooping cough, so the result is apparently specific to measles.</p>

<p>Vaccination had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/01/23/how-the-u-s-went-from-eliminating-measles-to-a-measles-outbreak-at-disneyland/">practically eliminated measles</a> from the United States by 2000. Since 2013 or so, we have experienced hundreds of cases, largely if not entirely due to the anti-vaccination movement (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy">MMR vaccine controversy</a>, which details the fraudulent but influential paper by Andrew Wakefield). Little did we know that the anti-vaxxers have put children in danger of contracting not only measles (a serious disease on its own, incidentally), but also other serious and potentially fatal diseases as well.</p>
