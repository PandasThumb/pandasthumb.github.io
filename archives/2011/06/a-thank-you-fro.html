  <p>On behalf of the TalkOrigins Foundation, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to our campaign to bid on the motion picture “Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.”  Unfortunately, we were unable to bid high enough to purchase the film.</p>

<p>The response to this last-minute campaign was overwhelming.  I had expected we might raise about $5,000. If we had raised $8,000, I would have been very pleased.</p>

<p>Instead, between Thursday (June 23), when we announced the campaign, and yesterday (June 27), we received 394 donations through our Paypal account, totaling $16,152.66.  We also received pledges of funds from several individuals, including Professor Richard Dawkins, totaling another $32,200.00.</p>

<p>Combined with the funds the Foundation already had on hand, we had just over $50,000 available to bid on the film (and pay the 10% buyer’s premium). The winning bid, however, was $201,000. Because all of the bidders were anonymous, we do not know identity of the winning bidder.</p>

<p>Although we were unsuccessful in purchasing the film, I do not believe this campaign was a waste of time. If nothing else, it demonstrated the commitment so many of you have to the tenets of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>The Foundation’s directors have discussed what to do in the event we were unsuccessful in purchasing the film.  We had stated in our fundraising solicitation that we could not guarantee a return of any donations.  That said, it has been our intent from the beginning to return all of the donations to this campaign, if that could be done.  It appears that Paypal will allow us to refund contributions made by credit card or from a Paypal balance.  (I do not know yet about those few eCheck transactions we received, but we will attempt to refund those as well.)</p>

<p>It will take some time for the refunding to be completed.  We cannot even begin refunding donations until we can transfer funds back from the Foundation’s bank account to Paypal, which will take a few days to clear.  Rest assured, however, that we will move as quickly as we can to complete the refunds.</p>

<p>Many of you have stated that you were happy with the Foundation keeping your donation in the event we were not successful in bidding on “Expelled.”  Although we greatly appreciate the sentiment, it will be simpler for us to return all donations made since June 23 than to sort out who does and who does not want their donation returned.</p>

<p>Our thanks again to all of you who contributed to this campaign.</p>

<p>Kenneth Fair<br />
Secretary/Treasurer, TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc.</p>
