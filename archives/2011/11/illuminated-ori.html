  <p>We just received the following letter from calligrapher Kelly Houle:</p>

<p>I am a natural history artist and calligrapher, and I’m creating a
large-scale <a href="http://www.illuminatedorigin.com/">illuminated manuscript</a> based on <em>The Origin of Species</em>. I’m
looking for ideas and advice from biologists and evolution experts like
you who might be willing to offer feedback on the scientific accuracy of
my illustrations and possibly contribute to the project. I am designing
each page as an individual work of art, writing out the entire text by
hand and illuminating the realistic natural history illustrations with
iridescent watercolors and 23-karat gold. <em>The Illuminated Origin of
Species</em> will be nearly 300 pages, each measuring 22x30 inches, with
over 500 illuminations. I would appreciate any constructive advice that
will help make <em>The Illuminated Origin of Species</em> as good as it can
be. Please contact me if you would be willing to serve as a science
advisor for the project.</p>

<p>I believe that the main barrier to understanding <em>The Origin of
Species</em> is the perceived difficulty of the writing. The concepts
themselves are simple, yet profound. I hope to improve understanding of
<em>The Origin</em> by integrating poetic arrangements of Darwin’s words with
visually striking presentations of the evidence. I will use elements of
poetry, traditional realism, lettering art, graphic design, and fine art
illustration in the service of communicating one of the most important
ideas in science.</p>

<p>I invite you to take a look at <em>The Illuminated Origin of Species</em> 
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/596922807/the-illuminated-origin-of-species?ref=email">here</a>. Once there, you can read about the project, watch a short video, and contribute if you wish. I’m writing the names of all donors in a special
section of the illuminated manuscript. I’m also giving gifts of art
related to <em>The Illuminated Origin</em> for donations of $10 or more. … I’m trying to raise $6000 by November 17 to create the first ten pages of <em>The Illuminated Origin
of Species</em>. I’m 2/3 of the way there with only a week to go.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about the project, I would love to
hear from you. For project updates, please take a minute to find <em>The
Illuminated Origin of Species</em> on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Illuminated-Origin-of-Species/177056949031355">Facebook</a>
and subscribe to 
<a href="http://www.illuminatedorigin.com/The_Illuminated_Origin_of_Species/Blog/Blog.ht">my blog</a>.
If you know anyone else who may want to be involved in this project,
please pass my information on to them. I am also seeking an
institutional donor to fund the entire project in exchange for the completed manuscript. I hope you will want to be one of the very first supporters of this historic endeavor.</p>
