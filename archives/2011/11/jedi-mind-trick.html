  <p>I’d like to thank Douglas and everyone for their kind words about my “cloning experiment” and impending appointment to Arizona State in Tempe.</p>

<p>I will be part of the <a href="http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/research/research-centers/evolutionary-medicine-and-informatics">Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics</a> in the Biodesign Institute and the <a href="http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_biodiv.php">Evolutionary Biology Program</a> in the School of Life Sciences.  I was hired as part of a genomics cluster, which is currently still hiring (Initial deadline is this Friday.  See the ad below.)  You could have the office next to me and Prof. Steve Steve.</p>

<p>I am looking to take students and graduate recruitment is underway.  I’m looking for students with a background in biology, computation, mathematics, and/or statistics and interested in studying evolution theory and bioinformatics.  I work on a variety of topics in computational evolutionary genetics, with most of my research dealing with mutations and developing analysis methods for detecting it from genomic data and high-throughput sequencing.  I also have research programs in frequency-dependent selection and scientific computing with Javascript.  If you are interested, you can check out my <a href="http://scit.us/cv.pdf">full CV</a>, but I’ve appended a list of recent papers to this post.  I can send anyone reprints if desired.</p>

<p>I’m also looking for undergraduate students to join my lab next semester as well.  So if you are a current or future ASU undergrad and want to work along side <a href="http://prof.stevesteve.org/">Prof. Steve Steve</a>, send me an email at cartwright@asu.edu.</p>

<p>The application deadline for the graduate program is December 15th, and the process is described <a href="http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_bio_apply.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Rice University is also looking for a postdoc to fill my vacated Huxley Fellowship.  See the ad below the fold.</p>

<h2 id="asu-graduate-program">ASU Graduate Program</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Graduate Program in Evolutionary Biology</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Biology PhD program at Arizona State University is
recruiting students for entry in the Fall 2012 semester. This new program is
interdisciplinary by design and enables faculty and students using diverse
models and technologies to engage in novel and innovative research to answer
questions related to a number of disciplines including ecology, behavior,
physiology, population genetics, bioinformatics, and anthropology.</p>

  <p>General information about the program as well as the application process and
materials can be found at: http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_bio.php</p>

  <p>Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact listed faculty to
inquire about potential openings, fellowships, and general questions about
research projects.</p>

  <p>Program questions can be directed towards either of the Evolutionary Biology
program chairs:</p>

  <p>Michael Rosenberg (msr@asu.edu)<br />
Brian Verrelli (brian.verrelli@asu.edu)</p>

  <p>Faculty Position in Genomics at Arizona State University</p>

  <p>The School of Life Sciences and The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State
University invite applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the
level of Assistant Professor whose research is at the interface between
Genomics and Life Sciences.  Research methods may include theoretical,
computational, and empirical approaches in population genetics, functional
and comparative genomics, and bioinformatics. The successful candidate will
be expected to develop an innovative, extramurally-funded, research program,
teach at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and have a commitment to
outreach and service. The successful candidate will be expected to mentor
undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. A
competitive start-up package and teaching load compatible with high research
productivity will be provided.</p>

  <p>Arizona State University has made a commitment to accelerating the
translation of basic discoveries into practical benefits for society through
the construction of state-of-the-art research facilities and the recruitment
of world-class faculty members. The successful candidate will participate in
university-wide health and/or sustainability initiatives supported by core
facilities for functional genomics and next generation sequencing,
functional proteomics, high throughput cellular screen, bioinformatics, high
performance computing, and imaging. More information on genomic research
opportunities at the Biodesign Institute and the School of Life Sciences at
ASU can be found at http://genomics.asu.edu.</p>

  <p>Candidates must have a Ph.D. (or equivalent) in an appropriate field, and a
minimum of 2 years of postdoctoral training is preferred. Demonstrated
teaching and research excellence is preferred.</p>

  <p>To apply, send cover letter, your curriculum vitae, three representative
publications, separate statements of future research plans and teaching
philosophy and interests, and contact information for three references to be
sent to Alan Rawls, Chair, Genomics Faculty Search Committee, School of Life
Sciences, PO Box 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287-4501. Electronic applications sent
