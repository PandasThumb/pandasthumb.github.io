  <p>(This  follows on from <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/01/a-storm-in-a-zo.html">my article</a> on the recent Astrology kerfuffle and was written (but not used) in 2005 for Australian Sky and Space. The positions are correct for 2005, but Mars has obviously moved by now)</p>

<p>Even  though the Sun passes through the classical constellation Ophiuchus, it  is not included in the astrological zodiac. Also Cetus,  where several planets can spend some time, is excluded (most recently  Mars was briefly in Cetus). As well, Pluto wanders a bit further from the  Zodiac than the others due to its high eccentricity, but the  constellations it wanders into are excluded from the astrological  zodiac. And what about asteroids, <a href="http://www.thegreenduck.com/ka/NewPlanets/quaoar.shtml">Kuiper belt objects</a>  and Plutinos? Astrologers are divided over whether to include them in  charts, and although you can find astrological predictions on the  internet that do include these objects, your average horoscopes exclude  them. And what about space probes? Size and mass is no obstacle to  astrological relevance, surely these messengers of human curiosity and  hope should be included? Sadly, they are not.</p>

<p>I think it is a  great shame that these constellations and objects are excluded from  western horoscopes, they would be far more colourful than the wishy-washy current versions that suggest that Mars may be making you a little  more aggressive. So I have written the kind of horoscope I would like  to see.</p>

<p><strong>Camoleopardis, the Giraffe</strong></p>

<p>You  may have to stick you neck out on this occasion. With Voyager 1 in your  sign, you have a restless urge to go boldly where no hominid has gone  before, but you only get as far as the video store before the bow shock  hits. On the 12th of September 2013, a piece of shuttle booster will  fall in the garden of all maiden aunts of Camoleopardians.</p>

<p><strong>Ophiuchus, the Serpent bearer</strong></p>

<p>You  will find yourself tied up in knots today. The influence of Quaoar  would normally help you find a creative way out of the loop, but Varuna  will rain on your parade. You may, or may not, have a life changing  decision to make on an odd numbered bus. Flipping a coin may, or may  not, assist you to come to a decision of some kind.</p>

<p><strong>Serpens: The serpent</strong></p>

<p>You  may be feeling a little bit snaky today, if not positively Stygian, and  the influence of Pluto in this constellation will make you feel colder  and glummer than before. At 12:15 am on Tuesday the hot water heater of  all Serpians will explode, making cold showers inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Cetus: The Whale</strong></p>

<p>With  Mars in conjunction with Sedna, International Whaling Commission  Members should beware of angry Inuit trying to sell blubber sandwiches.  On Friday all Cetians will find a harpoon embedded in their fishpond,  even if they didnâ€™t have a fishpond to start with.</p>

<p><strong>Some explanation:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna">Sedna</a> is the Innuit goddess of the sea, and protector of seals and whales. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50000_Quaoar">Quaoar</a> is a North American creation deity and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20000_Varuna">Varuna</a>  a water deity. The Kuiper Belt objects named after them really were in  the constellations named in 2005 when I wrote this, as was Voyager and  Pluto. Mars was in Cetus at the same time as Sedna .</p>
