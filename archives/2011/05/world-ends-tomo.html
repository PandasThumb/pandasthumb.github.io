  <p>I guess everyone knows it by now, but the world ends tomorrow.  I anticipate a headline the day after tomorrow, “The world ended yesterday.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/us/20rapture.html?pagewanted=all">human-interest article</a> in the <em>Times</em> was disturbing. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The three teenagers have been struggling to make sense of their shifting world, which started changing nearly two years ago when their mother, Abby Haddad Carson, left her job as a nurse to “sound the trumpet” on mission trips with her husband, Robert, handing out tracts. They stopped working on their house and saving for college. …</p>

  <p>“My mom has told me directly that I’m not going to get into heaven,” Grace Haddad, 16, said. “At first it was really upsetting, but it’s what she honestly believes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the children worry that there may not be enough money for college. They also have typical teenage angst – embarrassing parents – only amplified. 
“People look at my family and think I’m like that,” said Joseph, their 14-year-old, as his parents walked through the street fair on Ninth Avenue, giving out Bibles. “I keep my friends as far away from them as possible.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t really have any motivation to try to figure out what I want to do anymore,” he said, “because my main support line, my parents, don’t care.”</p>

  <p>His mother said she accepted that believers “lose friends and you lose family members in the process.”</p>

  <p>“I have mixed feelings,” Ms. Haddad Carson said. “I’m very excited about the Lord’s return, but I’m fearful that my children might get left behind. But you have to accept God’s will.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, the children have more sense than the parents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The children, however, have found something to giggle over. “She’ll say, ‘You need to clean up your room,’ ” Grace said. “And I’ll say, ‘Mom, it doesn’t matter, if the world’s going to end!’ ”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about those children if you think that extremist religious beliefs are harmless.</p>
