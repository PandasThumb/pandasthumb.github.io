  <p><strong>See update at the end of the post.</strong></p>

<p>John Freshwater, the Mt. Vernon, Ohio, middle school science teacher recently terminated by the Board of Education, <a href="http://www.coc.co.knox.oh.us/pa/">has filed a Notice of Appeal</a> (search by name for “Freshwater”) in the Knox County Court of Common Pleas.  A Notice of Appeal is just that: It notifies the court (and public) that the plaintiff intends to appeal a decision of some other body to that court–it essentially reserves the option to file an appeal but does not require filing.  Thereafter the plaintiff has a set period, typically 20 or 30 days (though I don’t know if teacher terminations have a different deadline), to file the appeal document itself detailing the respects in which the decision being appealed was allegedly faulty and therefore warrants overturning by the court.</p>

<p>Freshwater was terminated on two basic grounds outlined by the administrative hearing referee in his <a href="http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1545">final report</a>, violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution by teaching creationism and advocating for his fundamentalist Christian beliefs in school, and insubordination.</p>

<p>Freshwater filed the Notice of Appeal <em>pro se</em>, meaning that he is acting as his own attorney in the action.  I have no information on whether he will seek professional legal advice in preparing the actual appeal document.</p>

<p>I do not presently have links to copies of the documents Freshwater submitted with the Notice of Appeal except for Hamilton’s final brief, which is the <a href="http://mountvernon1805.yolasite.com/resources/Brief%20-%20John%20Freshwater%27s%20Closing%20Statement%20Brief%20-%20Copy%20-%20Copy.pdf">Closing Statement Brief</a> (4Mb PDF).  The most interesting documents appear to be “Complaint Filed with Resolution”, 
“Letter,” “John Freshwater’s Reply Brief to the Employer’s Post-Hearing Brief,” and “John Freshwater’s Closing Statement Brief.”    As much as I can obtain will all be online soon on the <a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/freshwater-termination-hearing">relevant NCSE page</a>.</p>

<p>If the Court of Common Pleas denies the appeal, the next (and last!) step would be for Freshwater to appeal that rejection to the state appellate court.</p>

<p>=======================</p>

<p><strong>Update:  I heard late this afternoon that Freshwater has gone ahead and actually filed his appeal, including the various documents and thousands of pages of the hearing transcript.  I hope to have more information tomorrow.</strong></p>
