&lt;/figure&gt;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
On June 7, 2023, Ken Ham tweeted that he was soon going to appear on Allie Beth Stuckey’s podcast “Relatable.” Ms. Stuckey has appeared  at at least one Answers in Genesis‘s “Answers for Women” conference and will be at one scheduled in 2024. Her description at AiG can be found [here](https://answersingenesis.org/bios/allie-beth-stuckey/). I was previously unfamiliar with Ms. Stuckey, or her popular podcast, so I decided to look closer and await Ken’s future appearance. I glanced at the titles of the more than 800 YouTube videos of the podcast that were available and watched short bits of several. Whew! What a vapid and reactionary show “Relatable” turned out to be! Almost every Christian Nationalist obsession and talking point of the last few years is covered by the podcast; everything from opposition to vaccination mandates to bizarre claims about Antifa being a major part of the January 6 insurrection, to an obsession with gay and transgender people. She could easily be a Tucker Carlson replacement on Fox News.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
One of her podcast videos in particular got my attention: Relatable, episode #670, from August 31, 2022, titled “I Don’t Know if Dinosaurs Were Real.” (See [here](https://youtu.be/kIxU5zG-dwg)). A major portion of this episode is a discussion of the host’s favorite conspiracy “theories” and an insipid discussion of the existence of aliens with her show’s producer and technical staff. 

While discussing whether or not the moon landings were real at 29 minutes 42 seconds into the episode Ms. Stuckey exclaims “I don’t know. Why haven’t we been back?” Then the conversation drifts into her conspiratorial views on dinosaurs. She blathers:

&gt; Here’s my conspiracy theory and I’ll just drop this and let y’all discuss what you think this is a theory, okay, I’m just gonna say this - Dinosaurs never existed. Thoughts? Discuss.” 

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

And a bit later:

&gt; Okay, so you’ve got these bones. You’ve got these fossils supposedly and supposedly date back millions of years and then I think it’s a bunch of nerds constructing this fantasy world that they think is awesome. Like, how do you know what the, like, skin of a pterodactyl looked like. How do you know what it sounded like? How do you know those things real? And, like, the different color patterns and all of that? How are you picking that up from bones? Now, some people, I don’t think I would go so far as to say this, but some people say it’s a conspiracy against, like, young earth creationism which says the earth is, like, 6,000 years old and you know obviously God created it that they tried to use that as no, the earth is like billions of years old and, like, we’ve evolved over time yada yada. I don’t know about all that, but if I were to pick like a theory. I’m, like, ugh, I could see dinosaurs not being real; I don’t know. And I don’t know about the Moon. I mean I used to say, oh yeah for sure, but then I started thinking about it. I was, like, I don’t know, maybe there is some credence to that. 

To their credit, her, and her producers, state they aren’t flat earthers. They then discuss the [Mandela Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect), with Ms. Stuckey stating that “some people” (identities not given) claim it is evidence for an “alternate universe.” Silly me always thought the concept was merely a demonstration of the weakness of human memory (but what do I know?).

Without irony, the show then delves into a discussion of whether or not a college education is necessary. Examples are given of professions you can learn by watching YouTube, such as tape editing, freeing one from spending a couple of hundred thousand dollars on a useless college degree (such a waste of money and loans!).

More than 35,500 people have viewed this nonsensical episode on YouTube. Before you laugh too hard, have I mentioned that Ms. Stuckey has a degree from Furman University? She is listed as a notable Furman alumnus on Wikipedia. As a part of their general education requirements, a Furman student must take two natural sciences, math, and formal reasoning classes. She also has testified before the US Congress, and appeared on CSPAN and FOX News. She probably has more influence in the world than you or I do.

I look forward to Ken Ham’s upcoming appearance on Relatable! Ken’s scientific knowledge is “incredible” in the most literal definition of the word. Will he be able to persuade Allie Beth Stuckey that dinosaurs were real (and on the Ark)? What about the Apollo program’s moon landings? Or will she convince him to give up dinosaurs (this would free up space on the Ark to sell more stuff)? Inquiring minds want to know! I shall do my best to report on the upcoming podcast when it becomes available. It is sure to be a true meeting of minds!
