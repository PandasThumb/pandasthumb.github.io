<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every so often, the Evolution News site run by the Discovery Institute 
brings in an expert to explain why the adaptations in organisms 
cannot be explained by natural evolutionary processes.  I was about 
to discuss the argument of one of these experts, when another,
even-more-impressive expert showed up.  For this post, I’ll 
discuss the arguments of the first one, the medical oncologist Dr. Stephen Iacoboni.
In the next part, I will consider those of
the particle physicist Dr. Eric Hedin, who 
is also Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry, Physics 
and Engineering at Biola University.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I do not doubt that Dr. Iacoboni is an “award-winning cancer 
researcher”.  But somehow these impressive 
credentials do not carry over into a discussion of natural 
selection.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dr. Iacoboni has written two articles at Evolution News, 
the first <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/04/a-new-look-at-natural-selection/"><em>A New Look at Natural Selection</em></a> on 
April 18, and
the second <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/05/natural-selection-subtracts-it-doesnt-add-and-that-matters/"><em>Natural selection subtracts, it doesn’t add – and that matters</em></a> on May 16.  The latter 
is decorated with the dramatic image of a constipated Polar Bear.</p>

<p>Iacoboni argues that all of the natural world, including 
all aspects of each organism’s environment, are designed, and 
it is this design that causes organisms to have adaptations.
So has the ability of natural selection to increase the adaptive 
information in the genomes of living organisms been decisively 
refuted by his argument?  Let’s see … (but no prize for guessing that my 
answer is going to be “no”).</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<h2 id="iacobonis-argument">Iacoboni’s argument</h2>

<p>Dr. Iacoboni’s post (<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/05/natural-selection-subtracts-it-doesnt-add-and-that-matters/A">here</a>) brings up examples of adaptations that seem to him to have no 
possible antecedent.  Then he hints at his refutation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There really is no reasonable way to believe that all of those trillions and trillions of modifications occurred randomly and without a designer.</p>

  <p>It has been said many times before but it is certainly worth repeating: Natural selection creates nothing. It only subtracts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, he mentions his alternative explanation for 
the evolution of adaptations: that all of every 
environment is designed, as everything in the universe 
is designed, and that these environments force the 
organisms’ phenotypes to fit them.  He promises more on 
that in future posts.
Leaving the rest of the universe aside, let’s consider 
the point that evolution “only subtracts”.</p>

<h2 id="why-evolution-adds-as-well-as-subtracts">Why evolution adds as well as subtracts</h2>

<p>Natural selection typically changes the gene frequencies in a 
population.  Can this “create”?  It can change the genotype 
of typical members of a population.  If 1&amp;percnt; of the copies 
at a locus are allele <em>A</em>, and the rest allele <em>a</em>, then we 
expect 0.0001 (that is, 1/100 of 1%) of the individuals 
in the population to have genotype <em>AA</em>, and 0.0198 of the 
individuals to have genotype <em>Aa</em>.  The rest (98.01%) 
are <em>aa</em>.  Once natural selection 
has changed the frequency of the <em>A</em> alele to bring it from 
1% up to 
99%, it is now the <em>AA</em> homozygote that makes up most of
the population, with <em>Aa</em> having risen to near 50% and 
then fallen back to 0.0198. <em>aa</em> will now be the genotype 
that has a frequency of 0.0001.</p>

<p>A typical creationist response is that these frequency changes
don’t matter: “new information” comes into the population 
only by mutation.  That is typical Creationist Information Theory. 
No actual specialist in information theory would take that 
seriously. Information theory calculates information using probabilities, not 
just the fact that both 0s and 1s can occur.  A gambler would 
not take the theory seriously either, if you told them that 
it doesn’t matter whether you win 99% of the time or 
1% of the time, all that matters is that sometimes 
you win.  Though they would suddenly get 
<em>very</em> interested in making a few private bets with you.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a detective is trying to discover 
who killed Professor Fudge in the library of the 
manor house, we will not be very satisfied when the 
detective simply presents us with a list of everyone who 
was in the house at the time.  We want him to subtract all the 
ones who didn’t commit the crime.</p>

<p>But when the differences in fitness are differences in 
viability (survival probability), don’t the deaths of 
members of the less-fit genotypes simply harm the population, 
without helping it?  If you know anything about population 
biology, you know that almost all populations have an 
excess of offspring.  Their numbers rise until they run 
into shortages of resources, such as food or nesting 
places.  And if natural selection kills off members of 
some genotypes, the population tends to recover, though 
now with a changed genetic composition.  So merely 
subtracting can be effective in changing the genetics 
of the population.</p>

<h2 id="genuinely-new-genotypes">Genuinely new genotypes</h2>

<p>Looking at more than one locus in the genome, we 
can see that natural selection really can result in new 
combinations of alleles.  Suppose that we look at 
two loci, one with alleles <em>A</em> and <em>a</em>, and the other 
with alleles <em>B</em> and <em>b</em>.  If <em>A</em> is rare, with 
a frequency of 0.001, and if <em>B</em> is also rare, with
a frequency of 0.0001, then there may be no genotypes 
in the population that contain both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>If both are favored by natural selection, as each
rises in gene frequency at its locus, sooner or 
later mating and recombination will bring them 
into the same individual, and into the same 
haploid gamete.  Initially, we had no AB gametes; 
now we have them.</p>

<p>With more than two loci, the 
effect is even greater.  When the favored alleles 
at many loci are all rare, it is unlikely that 
they can all be found in one individual.  That 
changes dramatically as they all rise in gene 
frequency.</p>

<p>Frequencies matter, and natural selection can 
change them.  That can result in bringing together 
new combinations of alleles in the genome.  You’d 
never know that from Iacoboni’s dismissal of 
natural selection.</p>

<h2 id="the-ghost-of-edward-blyth">The ghost of Edward Blyth</h2>

<p>Actually, interestingly enough, Iacoboni <em>does</em> 
think that natural selection is a real phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reducing this argument to more tangible physical terms, it seems that Darwin was unwilling to acknowledge that the fix for conscious selection was already embedded in an environment which had the innate ability to nurture creatures with capabilities suited to it. It is actually very important to be able to extract oxygen out of water if you are going to be a fish or a mollusk or a crustacean. It is actually important to have flippers and not fingers if you are going to be a marine mammal or penguin. It is important to have thick fur and to store fat if you are going to live in the snow. If you want to fly above it all you better have hollow bones and extremely strong pectoral muscles. If you want to burrow below the fray, you better have proper claws for digging. And if you are a pine tree, you need to have antifreeze in your needles if you are rooted beyond certain latitudes or elevations.</p>

  <p>Yes, indeed, natural selection is true. But that selection is not accomplished in the oxymoronic fashion of the inanimate acting with purpose. It is instead that the environment itself was designed with purpose so that it had the transcendent ability to nurture the arrival and survival of purpose-driven organisms on our glorious blue planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A somewhat similar argument was made by Edward Blyth, 
in articles in 1835-1837.  Blyth was an English 
ornithologist who worked 
mostly in India.  Charles Darwin corresponded with him 
and valued his expertise on the birds of India.
Blyth did not argue that natural selection brought 
about evolutionary change, but rather that it forced 
organisms to conform to their archetypes, keeping 
them precisely adapted and not allowing them to change 
away from that.  (It has been suggested that Darwin 
got natural selection from Blyth’s articles, but the 
dates of the discussion of it in Darwin’s notebooks 
disprove this).</p>

<p>Iacoboni goes farther than Blyth – he sees the environment 
as causing the “survival” of “purpose-driven organisms” but 
their “arrival” as well.  So the environment drives the process, 
and the biological process is “survival” of  better-adapted 
organisms.  But he doesn’t call that “natural selection”. 
Thus he has refuted natural selection while invoking it. 
All natural selection can do is “subtract”, but if the 
organism is not well-adapted to its niche, it gets 
subtracted.</p>

<p>Iacoboni is a teleologist, who sees the whole universe as 
designed.  To him it is that “telos” that brings about 
the change, and natural selection is just a fancy and 
misleading name for the grubby processes doing the 
dirty work.</p>
