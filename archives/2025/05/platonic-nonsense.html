<p>The Discovery Institute’s “Evolution News” is always a great place to look for tenuous and dubious arguments against evolutionary 
biology.  Lately they have been touting a book by EN journalist David Klinghoffer, published by Discovery Press, 
the DI’s house publisher.  The book is “<a href="https://discovery.press/b/platos-revenge/">Plato’s Revenge: The New Science of the Immaterial Genome</a>”.   Emily Sandico, a DI staff writer, has <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2025/04/platos-revenge-intelligent-design-in-real-time/">a piece calling attention to the book</a>.</p>

<p>The book by Klinghoffer describes the views of Richard Sternberg.  Sternberg has two 
Ph.D. degrees, one in molecular evolution and another in systems science.  His
own web page (<a href="https://richardsternberg.com/">here</a>) explains that, in his view</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evolutionary genetics leaves open the central issue of how the one dimensional genotype can specify the four dimensional phenotype. The approach I am taking to this problem is a variant of structural realism, by which I mean that biological phenomena are manifestations of logico-mathematical structures. This perspective is orthogonal to the origins debate, if you will, because all historical actualities are understood to be space-time instances of pre-existing non-temporal possibilities. Within this context one can accept all that is empirically valid in evolutionary biology, while not axiomatically dismissing the position that structures as well as their “real” instantiations have an intelligent cause. My position asserts that the cosmos is fundamentally intelligible in such a way that it can be logically, mathematically, and scientifically recognized to be such; and moreover–following Proclus–that the universe emanates from Nous (mind). In this sense my thinking is compatible with intelligent design broadly defined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sternberg’s site also links to <a href="https://www.discovery.org/f/54005/">a PDF</a> explaining in more detail how he came to his views.</p>

<p>To Klinghoffer, as quoted by Sandico’s post</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Dr. Sternberg thinks of ID, he’s thinking of the here and now. With echoes in the ancient philosophy of Plato, which pointed to immaterial “forms” shaping life, he finds scientific evidence of agency at work in the formation of every embryo, the development of every organism in the womb, and in the ongoing operation of every cell. The genome is not a material entity alone — DNA — but one that transcends space and time, employing DNA as an instrument, right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which he calls “intelligent design in real time”.  Andrew McDiarmid, EN’s head of podcasts, has interviewed Klinghoffer (<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2025/05/platos-revenge-the-next-scientific-revolution/">here</a>) about his book on Sternberg’s views.</p>

<p>To me this all sounds a bit strange.  Plato argued that real organisms were but imperfect reflections of ideal forms, which existed in some other realm. 
What evidence do Sternberg, Klinghoffer, Sandico, and McDiarmid have that this is so?  Let’s look at an example …</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>The example is explained by Daniel Witt, in an EN post (<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2025/02/biologist-michael-levin-a-farewell-to-physicalism/">here</a>), where he explains and interprets the views of Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University who works on developmental algorithms.  According to Witt’s explanation,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is important information in the DNA, of course. But organisms seem to develop with a goal in mind, so to speak, and are able reach that goal in spite of shifting and inherently unpredictable circumstances. This is significant, because if the circumstances and the developmental pathways necessary to adapt to them are unpredictable, then those pathways cannot have been programmed into the organism in advance. They have to be invented on-the-fly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another, more recent EN post about Levin’s views is by cancer researcher Steven Iacoboni (<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2025/04/life-itself-in-michael-levins-platonism-teleology-advances/">here</a>).
Levin gives his own summary of his views in a preprint available <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5g2xj_v2">from the Open Science Foundation site</a>.</p>

<p>Levin does invoke Platonism, and proposes that “mind” rather than physical entities are fundamental in nature.  Andreas Wagner, in his book “The Arrival of the Fittest” also ends up invoking Platonism and proposes that there may be “a library of forms” in nature.</p>

<h3 id="telos">Telos?</h3>

<p>The Evolution News posters view Levin’s and Wagner’s views as evidence for “telos” (goal-directedness) in nature, and argue that this is evidence for supernatural processes.  Levin and Wagner do not go that far.
A central argument at EN seems to be that if an organism can compensate for developmental accidents, and end up changing so as to achieve a desirable form, then this is only possible if there is telos, teleological change.
In particular, if organisms can anticipate the future and correct accidents of development, to these platonists this cannot be the result of mere physical changes in DNA sequences.</p>

<h3 id="no-nous">No nous</h3>

<p>But it could, and it’s not hard see how such a capability could evolve, without any overall plans that refer to platonic 
ideals.  Organisms exist in populations. Owing to processes such as mutation, recombination, and some types of 
natural selection, the members of the population vary genetically. Consider a worm developing, and an individual 
suffers damage around its mouth.  Different genotypes will differ in what happens after that.  Some of them 
will change in a direction thst brings the worm closer to having a functional mouth. many others will lead to 
an increasingly less functional mouth.  So different genotypes will vary in how fit the organism will be 
when affected by that damage.   Natural selection will of course favor the genotypes that are more fit when 
damage like that occurs.  No need to look up the ideal form in the Platonic encyclopedia in a supernatural 
realm.</p>

<p>Whenever organisms develop to anticipate future environments, ID advocates tend to regard this as 
evidence for supernatural intervention, or plans inserted into the species by Design.</p>

<p>Because, they 
argue, a material organism can only react to present conditions, and thus could not in principle 
develop so as to predict future environments, and how well various forms could cope with 
them.  But this is not necessary.  Consider a plant that sprouts from a seed in the spring, 
and grows for some months before flowering at an appropriate time in the summer.  Does doing 
that require supernaturally inserted algorithms, which push the plant towards its Platonic 
ideal life cycle. No. All that is necessary is some feedback from fitness to the 
genotypes.  And that of course is what natural selection does.</p>

<p>So no Nous is good news.</p>

<h3 id="a-library-of-forms-in-the-real-world">A library of forms in the real world?</h3>

<p>The biologists that the DI platonists refer to are less clearly referring to any 
supernatural processes.  Michael Levin comes closest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) instances	of	embodied	cognition	likewise	ingress	from	a	Platonic	space,	which	contains	not	only	low-agency	patterns	like	facts	about	triangles	and	prime	numbers,	but	also	higheragency	ones	such	as	kinds	of	minds;	(2) we	take	seriously	for	developmental,	synthetic,	and	behavioral	biologythe	 kinds of	 non-physicalist	 ideas	 that	 are	 already	 a	 staple	 of	 Platonist	mathematics; (3)	what	evolution	(and	bioengineering,	and	possibly AI)	produces	are	pointers	into	that	Platonic	space	–physicalinterfaces that	enable	the	ingression	of	specific	 patterns of	 body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To	recap,	the	first	pillar	of	the	proposed	framework	is	that	Platonic	forms	inject	information	and	influence	into	physical	events,	such	as	the	growth	and	form	of	biological	bodies.	The	second	is	that	this	latent	space	contains	not	only	boring,	low-agency	forms	such	as	facts	about	integers	and	geometric	shapes,	but	also	a	wide	range	of	increasingly	high-agency	patterns,	some	of	which	we	call	“kinds	of	minds”.	Thus,	I	propose	that	minds,	as	patterns	that	ensoul	somatic	embodiments,	are	of	exactly	the	kind	(but	not	in	degree)	of	non-physical	nature	as	the	patterns	that	inhabit	and	guide	the	behavior	of	biological	tissue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andreas Wagner instead <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/without-a-library-of-platonic-forms-evolution-couldn-t-work">proposes</a> that to understand evolution, 
a conceptual collection of all possible genome 
sequences, with the forms each sequence produces, is fundamental to understanding
evolution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So nature’s libraries and their sprawling networks go a long way towards explaining life’s capacity to evolve. But where do they come from? You cannot see them in the glass lizard or its anatomy. They are nowhere near life’s visible surface, nor are they underneath this surface, in the structure of its tissues and cells. They are not even in the submicroscopic structure of its DNA. They exist in a world of concepts, the kind of abstract concepts that mathematicians explore.</p>

  <p>Does that make them any less real?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature’s libraries are the fountains of biological innovation that Darwin was looking for. And unlike the realm of abstract forms that Plato envisioned, they are richer, more diverse, and more complex than the visible world. They harbour enough innovations for all the species Darwinian evolution has created – and could create. No planet would be large enough to explore all of them. The legless lizard and the rest of the living world, in all their glory, are just faint shadows of this Platonic realm of the possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stewart Kauffman has also insisted that evolutionary theory should incorporate 
descriptions of the connectedness of graphs describing organisms, in order 
to understand which complex structures might come, not from natural 
selection, but instead from random happenstance.</p>

<h3 id="platonism">Platonism?</h3>

<p>Levin and Wagner make the connection to Plato, but they do not seem to be 
describing a supernatural realm, rather a reconceived or extended reality.</p>

<p>The Discoverosphere at Evolution News takes their views as 
endorsing a dualism which has a supernatural world directing 
the natural world.  It is less than clear whether Levin or 
Wagner would agree.</p>

<p>For a blistering rejection of neo-platonic ideas as 
relevant to biological evolution, see also <a href="https://nautil.us/the-neo_platonic-argument-for-evolution-couldnt-be-more-wrong-236176/">Massimo 
Pigliucci’s 2016 essay</a>.</p>

<p>There is more to say about this, but others are better at the 
philosophy of biology, so I will look forward to what our commenters have to say, below.  The 
authors from Evolution News are of course welcome to participate.</p>
