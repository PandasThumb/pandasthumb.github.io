  <p>I got an unexpected opportunity to travel to Jackson, Wyoming, in the Grand Tetons,</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01441_Corrected_600.JPG" alt="Grand Tetons" />
</figure>

<p>to see the eclipse on August 21. I took a lot of pictures, but the bottom line is these phases of the eclipse:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/Strip_BW_600.png" alt="Phases of the eclipse" />
</figure>

<p>The sky was clear, the time was near noon, and you could see the moon eat into the sun right along the ecliptic.</p>

<p>More below the fold.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="more"></a>

<p>It was impossible to find “proper” photographic filters with the required optical density of 5 or 6 (an attenuation of 10<sup>5</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup>), so I cut up a pair of cardboard goggles, mounted them in an adapter ring, and screwed the assembly into a 300 mm (35-mm equivalent) zoom lens:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/IMG_1929_Camera_600.JPG" alt="Camera" />
</figure>

<p>Well before leaving, I took some test pictures of the sun:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01411_Test_600.JPG" alt="Picture of the sun" />
</figure>

<p>Yes, those are sunspots toward the lower left. Contrary to public opinion, the sun is white. I am uncertain why the image is red, but I presumed because the filter is not truly neutral, that is, gray. I saw a similar test picture somewhere before the eclipse, however, and the photographer had used a “proper” filter, yet his picture was also red. Perhaps some reader can, um, shed some light.</p>

<p>The entire expedition to Jackson cost an amount roughly equal to my grandson Toby’s inheritance, so I thought the least we could do was bring him along. This is a picture of Toby walking all over his mother Rachel along a trail to Phelps Lake:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01454_Toby_600.jpg" alt="Grandson" />
</figure>

<p>The eclipse began at 10:17 local time. I set my camera for F/8 and 1/250 s, consistently with the test photograph. I set the camera to exposure bracketing with an interval of 2 F-stops, so the camera took three pictures within a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>When the partial eclipse began, we used certified cardboard goggles to look at the sun:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/IMG_1930_Glasses_600.JPG" alt="Cardboard goggles" />
</figure>

<p>After a while, my wife Deanna grew tired of the goggles and broke out a pinhole camera she had made of a shoebox and a small pinhole punched with a needle into a black, 5-mil (125 μm) plastic sheet:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/IMG_1939_PH_Camera_600.JPG" alt="Pinhole camera image" />
</figure>

<p>When she tired of the pinhole camera, she took out a colander and observed multiple pinhole-camera images of the sun:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/IMG_1937_Colander_600.JPG" alt="Colander images" />
</figure>

<p>Meanwhile, I searched around for some similar images caused by the gaps between leaves in a tree. These images fell onto a beam on the side of a porch:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/IMG_1943_Shadows_600.JPG" alt="Images" />
</figure>

<p>Such images were known to the ancient Greeks and explained by Aristotle, but the pinhole camera was not developed for many centuries.</p>

<p>It began to get cold when the eclipse approached totality. I did not notice any insects or other creatures behaving oddly, but the local human population in a nearby park uttered sounds indicating excitement. They uttered similar sounds at the end of the period of totality. As for me, I removed the filter from the lens. Exposure bracketing was not particularly important during the partial phases of the eclipse, but I frankly did not want to spend my 2 min fiddling with a camera when I could be watching an eclipse. I estimated the exposures from a table kindly provided by <a href="http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/SEphoto.html">Fred Espenak</a>, who has posted a handful of guides for eclipse watchers. As before, I set the camera to take three exposures, 2 F-stops apart. I took a few pictures and then increased the exposure by 5 F-stops, before taking another few pictures.</p>

<p>The lowest exposures revealed some solar prominences:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01505_Prominences_600.JPG" alt="Solar prominences" />
</figure>

<p>One of the longest exposures showed the extent of the solar corona:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01510_Corona_600.JPG" alt="Solar corona" />
</figure>

<p>The period of totality ended all too quickly, and we saw the “diamond ring” as the sun emerged from behind the moon:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2017/DSC01514_Diamond_Ring_600.JPG" alt="Diamond ring" />
</figure>

<p>I am afraid the photograph is a bit overexposed (I never had particularly good reflexes), and I have no idea why part of the rim of the sun appears violet, but I assume it is an artifact of the photographic process. I think we can also see three prominences along the edge of the upper right quadrant.</p>

<p>For the next little while, the sun went through its previous phases in the reverse order, and the eclipse was done.</p>
