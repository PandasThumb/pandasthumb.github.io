SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 11-122 of Title 70, unless there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

A. The Oklahoma Legislature finds that an important purpose of science education is to inform students about scientific evidence and to help students develop critical thinking skills they need in order to become intelligent, productive and scientifically informed citizens. The Legislature further finds that the teaching of some scientific concepts including but not limited to premises in the areas of biology, chemistry, meteorology, bioethics and physics can cause controversy, and that some teachers may be unsure of the expectations concerning how they should present information on some subjects such as, but not limited to, biological evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming and human cloning.

B. The State Board of Education, district boards of education, district superintendents and administrators and public school principals and administrators shall endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions, learn about scientific evidence, develop critical thinking skills and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues. Educational authorities in this state shall also endeavor to assist teachers to find more effective ways to present the science curriculum where it addresses scientific controversies. Toward this end, teachers shall be permitted to help students understand, analyze, critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course being taught.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to exempt students from learning, understanding and being tested on curriculum as prescribed by state and local education standards.

E. The provisions of the Scientific Education and Academic Freedom Act shall only protect the teaching of scientific information and shall not be construed to promote any religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or nonbeliefs or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion. The intent of the provisions of the act is to create an environment in which both the teacher and students can openly and objectively discuss the facts and observations of science and the assumptions that underlie their interpretation.

F. By no later than the start of the 2016-2017 school year, the State Department of Education shall notify all district superintendents of the provisions of the Scientific Education and Academic Freedom Act. Each superintendent shall then disseminate to all employees within the district a copy of the provisions of the act.

SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2016.

SENATE RESOLUTION No. 17

DIGEST OF RESOLUTION

A SENATE RESOLUTION urging the Department of Education to reinforce support of teachers who choose to teach a diverse curriculum.

Raatz, Kruse

February 23, 2017, reported favorably — Do Pass.

February 24, 2017

First Regular Session 120th General Assembly (2017)

SENATE RESOLUTION No. 17

MADAME PRESIDENT:

I offer the following resolution and move its adoption:

A SENATE RESOLUTION urging the Department of Education to reinforce support of teachers who choose to teach a diverse curriculum.

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly understands that an important purpose of science education is to inform students about scientific evidence and to help students develop the critical thinking skills they need in order to become intelligent, productive, and scientifically informed citizens;

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly further understands the recommendation by the U.S. Congress, as stated in the report language of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, namely, "Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), that the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics can generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society";

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly further understands that the ACLU and like organizations agree in principle that any genuinely scientific evidence for or against any explanation of life may be taught;

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly urges in principle the recommendation by U.S. Congress as stated above;

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly understands that neither recommendations, nor endorsements, nor implications by the courts have the force of law, but to avoid legal or other conflicts, teachers should not be intimidated, fired, or restricted from following the recommendation named herein or students penalized for holding differing positions based on the evidence objectively presented, as long as they meet specified curriculum requirements otherwise;

Whereas, the Indiana General Assembly understands that neither the specified recommendation nor endorsement extends to the promotion of any religious or non-religious doctrine, or to the promotion or discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or non-beliefs, or the promotion or discrimination for or against religion or non-religion; and

Whereas, The Indiana General Assembly urges the Department of Education to notify all public school system superintendents of the provisions herein that they might disseminate copies to all their employees within their district:

Therefore,

Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana:

SECTION 1. That the Indiana Senate urges the Department of Education to reinforce support of teachers who choose to teach a diverse curriculum.

SECTION 2. The Secretary of the Senate is hereby directed to transmit a copy of this Resolution to the Indiana Department of Education.


COMMITTEE REPORT

Madam President: The Senate Committee on Education and Career Development, to which was referred Senate Resolution No. 17, has had the same under consideration and begs leave to report the same back to the Senate with the recommendation that said resolution DO PASS.

WHEREAS, some teachers may be unsure of the expectation concerning how they should present information when controversy occurs on such subjects; now therefore, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That we strongly urge:

(a) The State Board of Education, public elementary and secondary school governing authorities, directors of schools, school system administrators, and public elementary and secondary school principals and administrators and teachers should endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions, develop critical thinking skills, analyze the scientific strengths and weaknesses of scientific explanations, and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about scientific subjects required to be taught under the curriculum framework developed by the State Board of Education.

(b) The State Board of Education, public elementary or secondary school governing authorities, directors of schools, school system administrators, and public elementary or secondary school principals and administrators should refrain from prohibiting any teacher in a public school system of this state from helping students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories covered in the course being taught within the curriculum framework developed by the State Board of Education.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution is intended to support the teaching of scientific information and shall not be construed to promote any religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or non-beliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion or non-religion.

HB258

188434-1

By Representative Hurst

RFD: Education Policy

First Read: 18-JAN-18

SYNOPSIS: This bill would enable public school teachers who teach kindergarten through 12th grade to include, as a portion of instruction regarding the scientific origins of man and the Earth, instruction regarding the Biblical theory of creation, so long as evolution is also taught. This bill would further allow any teacher who desires to instruct students regarding the Biblical theory of creation to read passages from the Bible in class which he or she deems necessary to propel the instruction forward.

This bill would allow a student receiving instruction on both the Biblical theory of creation and evolution to make a determination as to which theory to accept. A student would be permitted credit on course exams if he or she chooses to adhere to the Biblical theory of creation instead of evolution and then answers exam questions according to that system of belief.

Relating to education; to permit the teaching of the Biblical theory of creation in public K-12 schools under certain conditions.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:

Section 1. (a) In any public K-12 school instruction concerning the theories of the creation of man and the Earth, and which involves the theory commonly known as evolution, any teacher may include as a portion of instruction the theory of creation as presented in the Bible, and may read passages in the Bible as deemed necessary for instruction on the theory of creation, thereby affording students a choice as to which theory to accept.

(b) For those students receiving instruction as described in subsection (a), and who accept the Bible theory of creation, credit shall be permitted on any examination in which the student provides a response in adherence to the theory, provided the response is correct according to the instruction received.

(c) A teacher in a public K-12 school may not stress any particular denominational religious belief.

Section 2. This act shall become effective on the first day of the third month following its passage and approval by the Governor, or its otherwise becoming law.
