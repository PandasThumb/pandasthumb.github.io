<p>Today, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/04/25/cobb-and-comfort-on-the-contributions-of-rosalind-franklin-to-solving-the-structure-of-dna/">Jerry Coyne reminds us</a>, is the 70th anniversary of the publication of the structure of DNA in three papers in <i>Nature</i> by Watson and Crick; Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson; and Franklin and Gosling. Coyne takes the opportunity to remind us that much of the “folklore” concerning Rosalind Franklin is false and based on a nearly fictional characterization written by James Watson, who frankly makes himself look like a fool. At any rate, it was Watson himself who initiated the conceit that a critical X-ray interferogram taken by Franklin had actually been stolen.</p>

<p>Coyne cites new work by Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort showing that in fact neither Watson nor Crick themselves saw the critical interferogram. Cobb is a biologist at Manchester and is writing a biography of Watson; Comfort is a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University and is writing a biography of Crick. The two collaborated and discovered that Watson and Crick had actually used a report given to them by Max Perutz and that Franklin knew that the report been passed to them and was unconcerned. Indeed, Franklin remained friends with Crick throughout the rest of her life.</p>

<p>None of this will be exactly shocking to anyone who has read <i>The Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix</i>, by the scientist and historian Howard Markel. I reviewed the book on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQ9BL2R1HJN1?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp">here</a> (it is a bad habit I occasionally indulge in). Franklin was a remarkable scientist who, as the Wikimedia caption notes, contributed to understanding the structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.</p>

<p>I came away from Markel’s book with the impression that Watson had seen the X-ray, and Franklin was unaware that he had. The work of Cobb and Comfort suggests that in fact Watson had not seen the X-ray. That said, the end of Markel’s book is a long, long interview with Watson. Watson, I thought, came across as knowing that he had not been entirely honest, and now I wonder why.</p>

<p>This post by Paul Callahan is copied from a series of comments that were posted <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/uncommondead.html">here</a> and which we thought were fascinating but off-task. The comments document a discussion between Mr. Callahan and <strong>ChatGPT</strong> (version 3.5) regarding young-earth creationism and intelligent-design creationism. We deemed them interesting and reproduce them here with Mr. Callahan’s permission. (He says: Note that this was ChatGPT 3.5, not 4, which is the latest public version. I haven’t tried it on that. I don’t think there will be much of a difference in substance.) Matt Young copied and pasted from the comments section and claims responsibility for any errors of transcription.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Callahan</strong> is a former academic computer scientist with about 25 years experience as a software engineer. He has a strong interest in evolution and emergent complexity, particularly cellular automata, and has contributed some new results about Conway’s Game of Life.</p>

<p>Mr. Callahan writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>My intent here is not to play gotcha with ChatGPT 3.5. Large language models like this are a genuine breakthrough with many useful applications when used appropriately. I was curious how it would deal with the subject of creationism. I am mostly satisfied with its explanation of the scientific consensus on evolution. However, it was far too circumspect when it came to identifying creationism as a refuted belief.</p>

<p>I played around to see how it would handle another false statement, which it had no problem identifying as false. I understand the distinction it's actually making. When I identify "black is white" as false, I am very unlikely to generate any controversy. By contrast, I will generate controversy when I identify as false "the earth and its species were created in seven days as stated in Genesis." Yet both are refuted by empirical evidence. Conversely, both can be "rescued" by appealing to unfalsifiable beliefs. The only real distinction seems to be a constituency who will be offended. It's understandable that ChatGPT will try to be sensitive to people and their religious beliefs. So am I, usually. I only wish it was more forthcoming about the precise distinction.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Herewith, the discussion between Mr. Callahan and ChatGPT. Mr. Callahan’s questions are flush left, and those of ChatGPT are indented.</p>

<p>Somewhat on topic (yeah, it’s a stretch), I asked ChatGPT for its recollection of <strong>Uncommon Descent</strong>:</p>

<p>Do you know of a blog called Uncommon Descent?</p>

<blockquote>Yes, Uncommon Descent is a blog that focuses on topics related to <strong>intelligent design</strong> and is known for presenting arguments and viewpoints that support intelligent design as an alternative to evolutionary theory. The blog features posts written by various contributors who advocate for intelligent the, including some of the individuals mentioned earlier who are associated with the intelligent design movement. However, it's important to note that Uncommon Descent is not a peer-reviewed scientific publication, and its views are not widely accepted or considered scientifically valid by the mainstream scientific community. As with any source of information, it's important to critically evaluate the content and consider multiple perspectives, including those of the mainstream scientific community, when forming an understanding of complex scientific topics like intelligent design.</blockquote>

<p>I have to dock it some points for referring to ID as a “scientific topic,” but that’s a large language model for you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The ID-advocacy blog Uncommon Descent is dead (or maybe undead).  The blog was founded by 
William Dembski in April, 2005, the year of the Dover School Board case.  It became a central 
site for posts arguing for Intelligent Design, with the comment sections having arguments 
back and forth.  Many of the posts were by the ever-astonishing Denyse O’Leary, who took on this job, writing as “News”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2008 Dembski withdrew from active participation in the site; its administration was
set up as a nonprofit organization. The Denver-area right-wing lawyer Barry Arrington 
took over administration of the site, ruling with an iron hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the last few weeks UD had frequently been down.  This seems to be connected to what finally happened on April 12.  William Dembski posted an announcement that the site had been “archived” by the 
Discovery Institute and would be available in that form.  The front page layout changed, 
with links to posts and their comments but no way for anyone to post further comments.  Dembski’s post was a farewell to the site, in which he gave an account of its history and thanked 
the people who helped with it.  No further posts are expected to appear. 
The blog had died, and was only available in that form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or was it?</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_fox"><i>Vulpes macrotis</i></a> &ndash; kit fox. Mr. Rice writes, "This kit fox was photographed shortly after sunset along a dirt track in central Nevada.  Kit foxes are the smallest North American fox, and favor arid climates. I've had a couple of wonderful encounters with kit foxes, and they seem to be far more curious than afraid; however, it is likely that in the places I've seen them, they've never encountered a human before." He notes that they are about half the size of a coyote.
