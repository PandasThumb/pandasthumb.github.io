<p>A <i>New York Times</i> article yesterday reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html">Kennedy Sought to Stop Covid Vaccinations 6 Months After Rollout</a>. The Kennedy in question is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald J. Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the <i>Times</i> reports that in May, 2021, Mr. Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration, "demanding that officials rescind authorization for the shots and refrain from approving any Covid vaccine in the future." Mr. Kennedy's petition </p>
<blockquote>claimed that the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits and that the vaccines weren’t necessary because good treatments were available, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which had already been deemed ineffective against the virus. </blockquote>
<p>Hardly anyone noticed at the time, and the petition was promptly denied. Now, however, Mr. Kennedy has been nominated to head HHS, a move that the epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves compared to "putting a flat earther in charge of NASA," which as far as I am concerned may be too kind to Mr. Kennedy. </p>

<p>A little bird, who chirped anonymity, led us to an article by the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/10/covid-19-vaccines-prevented-nearly-140000-us-deaths">COVID-19 Vaccines Prevented Nearly 140,000 U.S. Deaths</a> through May, 2021, the very date when Mr. Kennedy submitted his petition. NIH claims, </p>
<blockquote>About 570,000 people died of COVID-19 in the U.S. through that time. The [statistical] model [used in the study] estimated that there would have been about 709,000 deaths without the vaccines.</blockquote>
<p>A later study, titled <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations">Two Years of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccines Have Prevented Millions of Hospitalizations and Deaths</a>, found, </p>
<blockquote>From December 2020 through November 2022, we estimate that the COVID-19 vaccination program in the U.S. prevented more than 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million additional deaths. Without vaccination, there would have been nearly 120 million more COVID-19 infections. The vaccination program also saved the U.S. $1.15 trillion (Credible Interval: $1.10 trillion–$1.19 trillion) (data not shown) in medical costs that would otherwise have been incurred. [Parentheses in original.]</blockquote>
<p>Note: Possibly 3 million additional deaths if Mr. Kennedy's petition had been granted. That is approximately the population of Kansas.</p>
<p>The frontispiece to this article, incidentally, shows weekly Covid death rates by vaccination status from October 9, 2021 through April 1, 2023. (The article includes a nice discussion explaining why rates, not absolute numbers, are critical.) The result is striking: At the peak in January, 2022, the death rate among unvaccinated people was approximately 10 times that among vaccinated people. Let us hope that Mr. Kennedy has learned something since 2021.</p>

        <p>I once published an article in a proprietary journal. It was new, it had no page charges, and I had no funding. Little did I know that it was the bare tip of an iceberg of proprietary journals that would, among other faults, strain university libraries to the breaking point. I have been apologizing ever since.</p>

<p>It gets worse. A day or so ago, a colleague sent us a post that included a press release to the effect that the editorial board of the <i>Journal of Human Evolution</i>, a proprietary Elsevier journal, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markgrabowski.bsky.social/post/3le7wqrryhc2y">had resigned en masse</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier">Elsevier</a> is an academic publishing firm that, according to Wikipedia, enjoyed a profit of £2.3 billion and a profit margin of 33 % in 2023.</p>

<p>According to the press release, which was posted by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution ">Mark Grabowski, a co-editor with Andrea B. Taylor</a>, the <i>Journal of Human Evolution</i> is the “flagship journal in paleoanthropological and human evolution research,” but “Elsevier has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining [its] core principles and practices….” The editors note, among other complaints, that Elsevier has eliminated the position of copy editor on the grounds that “the editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting.” The result is that errors that were not found in the original manuscript are introduced during the production of the paper. The editors further complain about the cost of page charges and open access charges to institutions, and the relative paucity of institutions with whom Elsevier has negotiated open access agreements.</p>

<p>The two editors-in-chief, the emeritus editors, and all associate editors but one, “with heartfelt sadness and great regret,” therefore have resigned.</p>

<p>Finally, there is an elephant in the room, and he is hiding in plain sight in footnote 2: artificial intelligence. The press release notes that, without telling anyone, Elsevier introduced artificial intelligence during some phase of production and generated articles in which proper nouns (including epochs, site names, countries, cities, and genera) were not capitalized, and genera and species were not italicized. Thus, papers that had been properly formatted became embarrassingly wrong, and it took the persistent efforts of the editors over six months to resolve the problem. The footnote concludes, “AI processing … regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stage.”</p>

You may find Elsevier’s open access agreements <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/agreements">here</a>; there are only a couple of dozen or so in the United States. My thanks to several Panda’s Thumbelinos for providing the press release and making perceptive suggestions ahead of my drafting the present post.</p>

The photographer writes, "I was in the garden when this butterfly startled me, as it was so close and came in to land and rest under the log. Very well camouflaged. I didn't see its open wing. It didn't mind me being there. I've never seen one before." Additionally, BugGuide discusses why "c" and why "album" <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/722347">here</a>. Album means white, but the creature looks anything but white to me.

<p><b>UPDATE, Dec. 22: I have now listed 52 separate events I found, including links and quotes of the summaries where available. Please contribute more in the comments!</b></p>

<p>Merry Kitzmas to all!  Today is the 19th anniversary of the <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</i> trial, aka the Dover Panda Trial, held from September-November 2005, and decided on December 20, 2005.</p>

<p>Next year, 2025, will be the 20th anniversary of Kitzmiller, as well as the 100th anniversary of <i>Tennessee v. Scopes</i>, aka the Scopes Monkey Trial.</p>

<p>Stuck as I am, in Australia/New Zealand with 3 little kids, I expect I will have to follow events from afar.  But I will use this thread to accumulate links &amp; dates for relevant events as they come up. And please contribute ones you come across!</p>

<p>I expect that many are glum about current politics and science, but I recall a similar feeling in 2004, and that <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> was one of the early signs that committed citizens could move events in a pro-science direction. May 2025 be another such time!</p>

<p>Summaries of events are posted below, with abstracts where available:</p>
