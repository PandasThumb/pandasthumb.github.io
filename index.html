<p>According to an article by Noelle Phillips in today’s Boulder Daily Camera, “<a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2025/01/17/flat-earth-final-experiment-antarctica-will-duffy/"><strong>A Colorado pastor thought he could make flat-Earthers see the light in Antarctica. It didn’t work.</strong></a> Will Duffy traveled to bottom of the world last month to stage ‘The Final Experiment’ under 24 hours of sunlight[.]”</p>

<p>That about says it all: The flat-earthers could not believe the result and spent their time developing conspiracy theories to maintain their belief in the flat earth.</p>

<p>I got curious about Will Duffy. He is pastor of <a href="https://www.akf.church/">Agape Kingdom Fellowship</a> of Wheatridge, Colorado. Their <a href="https://www.akf.church/faith">Statement of Faith</a> assures us, “[God] made the heavens and the earth and everything in them in six literal days[.]” Are we surprised? Mr. Duffy is a young-earth creationist. The flat-earthers, however, are too goofy even for him.</p>

<p>Incontrovertible evidence will not convince flat-earthers that the earth is round. What will it take to convince Mr. Duffy that the earth is very, very old?</p>

<p>A <i>New York Times</i> article yesterday reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html">Kennedy Sought to Stop Covid Vaccinations 6 Months After Rollout</a>. The Kennedy in question is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald J. Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the <i>Times</i> reports that in May, 2021, Mr. Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration, "demanding that officials rescind authorization for the shots and refrain from approving any Covid vaccine in the future." Mr. Kennedy's petition </p>
<blockquote>claimed that the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits and that the vaccines weren’t necessary because good treatments were available, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which had already been deemed ineffective against the virus. </blockquote>
<p>Hardly anyone noticed at the time, and the petition was promptly denied. Now, however, Mr. Kennedy has been nominated to head HHS, a move that the epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves compared to "putting a flat earther in charge of NASA," which as far as I am concerned may be too kind to Mr. Kennedy. </p>

<p>A little bird, who chirped anonymity, led us to an article by the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/10/covid-19-vaccines-prevented-nearly-140000-us-deaths">COVID-19 Vaccines Prevented Nearly 140,000 U.S. Deaths</a> through May, 2021, the very date when Mr. Kennedy submitted his petition.

        <p>I once published an article in a proprietary journal. It was new, it had no page charges, and I had no funding. Little did I know that it was the bare tip of an iceberg of proprietary journals that would, among other faults, strain university libraries to the breaking point. I have been apologizing ever since.</p>

<p>It gets worse. A day or so ago, a colleague sent us a post that included a press release to the effect that the editorial board of the <i>Journal of Human Evolution</i>, a proprietary Elsevier journal, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markgrabowski.bsky.social/post/3le7wqrryhc2y">had resigned en masse</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier">Elsevier</a> is an academic publishing firm that, according to Wikipedia, enjoyed a profit of £2.3 billion and a profit margin of 33 % in 2023.</p>

<p>According to the press release, which was posted by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution ">Mark Grabowski, a co-editor with Andrea B. Taylor</a>, the <i>Journal of Human Evolution</i> is the “flagship journal in paleoanthropological and human evolution research,” but “Elsevier has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining [its] core principles and practices….” The editors note, among other complaints, that Elsevier has eliminated the position of copy editor on the grounds that “the editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting.” The result is that errors that were not found in the original manuscript are introduced during the production of the paper. The editors further complain about the cost of page charges and open access charges to institutions, and the relative paucity of institutions with whom Elsevier has negotiated open access agreements.</p>

<p>The two editors-in-chief, the emeritus editors, and all associate editors but one, “with heartfelt sadness and great regret,” therefore have resigned.</p>

<p>Finally, there is an elephant in the room, and he is hiding in plain sight in footnote 2: artificial intelligence. The press release notes that, without telling anyone, Elsevier introduced artificial intelligence during some phase of production and generated articles in which proper nouns (including epochs, site names, countries, cities, and genera) were not capitalized, and genera and species were not italicized. Thus, papers that had been properly formatted became embarrassingly wrong, and it took the persistent efforts of the editors over six months to resolve the problem. The footnote concludes, “AI processing … regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stage.”</p>

You may find Elsevier’s open access agreements <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/agreements">here</a>; there are only a couple of dozen or so in the United States. My thanks to several Panda’s Thumbelinos for providing the press release and making perceptive suggestions ahead of my drafting the present post.</p>

The photographer writes, "I was in the garden when this butterfly startled me, as it was so close and came in to land and rest under the log. Very well camouflaged. I didn't see its open wing. It didn't mind me being there. I've never seen one before." Additionally, BugGuide discusses why "c" and why "album" <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/722347">here</a>. Album means white, but the creature looks anything but white to me.
