<p><i>Andrew J Petto is Distinguished Lecturer Emeritus in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, where he taught anatomy and physiology, human gross anatomy, and kinesiology courses. He is a bioanthropologist with a concentration on primate functional morphology. His latest book, as a co-author with Alice Beck Kehoe, is <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003226819/humans-alice-beck-kehoe-andrew-petto">&lt;/i&gt;Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology<i>&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd ed. New York: Routledge. 2022 (Dec).</i></a></i></p>

<p>The story of <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> is the story of the emergence of the human evolutionary branch from the last common ancestor of the African ape clades (evolutionary branches): humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. It is a story of transitions. To understand the importance of <i>Sahelanthropus</i> in reconstructing human evolutionary history, we could paraphrase Dobzhansky’s famous quotation: “Nothing in <i>Sahelanthropus</i> biology makes sense except in the light of evolutionary transition” (Dobzhansky 1973).</p>

<p>Since its discovery in 2001, <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i>  has intrigued scientists (Brunet et al. 2002). Nicknamed “Toumai” which means “hope of life” in the local language, it is (so far) the oldest fossil on our human evolutionary branch, and it is very close to the time when this evolutionary branch separated from the last common ancestor with the other African great apes.</p>

<i>Sahelanthropus</i> is located at the bottom right of the chart in Figure 1, living between 7 and 6 million years before present. (A quick overview of the major findings about this species is available <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/Sahelanthropus-tchadensis">here</a>.)

<p>A relative of mine is a practicing psychologist. Among other things, she favors trans women participating in women’s sports and affirmative care for transgender teenagers. Quite innocently, I asked her whether she had ever read the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Irreversible-Damage-Transgender-Seducing-Daughters-ebook/dp/B07YL6XK55/">Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters</a>, by Abigail Shrier. She responded by making what is conventionally called “a face.”</p>

<p>I think she should read the book, if only to find out firsthand what her adversaries think. As for me, I have long since tired of Dembski, Behe, Schroeder, and their ilk, not to mention Ken Ham, so I turned to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Power-Glory-Evangelicals-Extremism-ebook/dp/B0BTYWH2YP">The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory</a>, subtitled American Evangelicals in an Age of Extremism, by the veteran journalist Tim Alberta. And a splendid book it is, despite your probably justified suspicion that Alberta and I would agree on very little, theologically and possibly politically (according to his <a href="https://www.bytimalberta.com">home page</a>, Alberta worked for the <i>National Review</i>, <i>Politico</i>, and now <i>The Atlantic</i>, so we may be observing some evolution in action, but I could not find anything specifically concerning his political affiliation, if any).</p>

<p>The book concerns Christian nationalism, and how so many American evangelicals, in my reading, at least, learned to idolatrize the United States and conflate their conservative religious beliefs with conservative, even reactionary politics. Alberta gets his material by traveling around the country for approximately 4 years and interviewing countless evangelical pastors and their parishioners. Though I found the book a little long at times, I thought it worked well.</p>

<p>Panda’s Thumb readers may recall <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/07/2024-07-12-vitalism-NZ-science_education.html">my 2022 post</a> on the controversy in New Zealand about the the NZ Ministry of Education sticking the concept of “mauri” into the high school Chemistry/Biology curriculum.</p>

<p>As I said at the time, this content was a big problem scientifically, as it was inserting vitalism into basic chemistry. I also made a prediction which some were skeptical of, that it would eventually have to be taken out. In October 2022, Paul Kilmartin, the chemistry professor whose talk I quoted, published a detailed analysis of the issue in <a href="https://nzic.org.nz/unsecure_files/cinz/2022-86-4.pdf">the journal <i>Chemistry in New Zealand</i></a>. <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-im-sticking-up-for-science/">Richard Dawkins</a> and others eventually commented.  In early 2024, <i>Science</i> published a Policy Forum article, by Black and Tyliankankis, “<a href="">Teach Indigenous knowledge alongside science</a>,” which cited Dawkins’s critique and rebutted it by proclaiming the virtues of the Ministry of Education’s policy of “Mana ōrite: equal status for mātauranga Māori.” However, Black and Tyliankankis left out any discussion of Dawkins’s mention of vitalism, or indeed any discussion of the controversy over the mauri/vitalism issue.</p>

<p>I viewed this as pretty misleading, especially because, in late 2022, the Ministry of Education’s mana ōrite policy began to come crashing down, at least for science education. Mauri and a variety of other material was stripped out, the schedule for the rollout of the NCEA Level 1 science curriculum (15-16 year olds) was pushed back by years (it looks like the whole approach may be being scrapped by the new government, elected in late 2023; NCEA Levels 2 and 3 have been pushed back by several more years), and several other scandals involving the science curriculum reform <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=science%20education%20nz&amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;gl=NZ&amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen">hit the news in 2023-2024</a>.</p>

<p>To inform <i>Science</i>’s readership about some of the problems, I wrote a response letter which has just been published. Another response was also published by a group of New Zealand scientists and academics (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado6679">Adhar et al. 2024</a>), along with <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9278">a reply from Black and Tylianakis</a>.</p>

<p>I paste the final text of my letter below. Here is a link to free access to my and other letters: <a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1981/full">https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1981/full</a></p>

<p><i>(Asides: (1) Unfortunately, some copyediting misadventure occurred after my last look at the proof; I clarify after the main text. (2) I have added the full references for google-ability. (3) If it had been up to me, I would not have italicized “mauri” except for the first non-quoted instance. I follow my preference below.)

A. Black and J. M. Tylianakis ("Teach Indigenous knowledge alongside science," Policy Forum, 9 February, p. 592) give an overly rosy picture of New Zealand's policy of "mana ōrite," or equal status for mātauranga Māori, in science education, which they say teaches Indigenous knowledge "alongside" science rather than "as" science. They suggest that this policy avoids problems such as teaching creationist myths in science class. However, the New Zealand Ministry of Education placed supernatural content directly into science and math curricula with no clarification that it was nonscientific material.

<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Great_Blue_Heron/overview"><i>Ardea herodias herodias</i></a> – great blue heron with red-bellied watersnake <a href="https://herpsofnc.org/red-bellied-watersnake">Nerodia erythrogaster</a>. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "Late afternoon on World Migratory Bird Day last year, having little luck all day, my brother spotted this heron and we realized it had a capture. The snake was still writhing as we attempted to get close enough for a clean shot, and managed it just before the heron flew off with its prey. It's challenging enough for a heron to get a large fish in the right position to swallow whole &ndash; I imagine it's quite a bit harder with something as wickedly aggressive as a watersnake, though we missed that action. There are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_blue_heron">four recognized subspecies of great blue herons</a>, with the possibility of <i>A. h. wardi</i> creeping into the area, but this is much more likely <i>A. h. herodias</i>, as noted.

<p>We received only around a dozen submissions this year, and all were very good indeed. In the past, we have polled our readers, but participation in the polls has dropped off. We therefore decided, consistently with Rules 8 and 12, to choose the winners ourselves rather than poll our readers. In this endeavor, we enlisted the assistance of our Wife and Harshest Critic, Deanna, and also our Son the Geek, David. Deanna grew up making dye transfers, and David is a formidable photographer himself. The one thing we three agreed upon was to place Al Denelsbeck’s photograph of what David called “sad snake, happy bird” first. We will announce the runner-up and the bronze medalist, so to speak, in subsequent weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Denelsbeck, who blogs <a href="https://wading-in.net/">here</a>, will be offered his choice between Why Intelligent Design Fails, A Scientific Critique of the New Creationism, edited by Taner Edis and me (and autographed by me); and What’s Gotten Into You by Dan Levitt, generously contributed by NCSE. The runner-up will be offered the remaining book.</p>
