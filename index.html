<p><i>The original title of this article, borrowed (as you may infer) from Ken Ham, was "Here's What People NEED To Know about Ken Ham." That title now seems too cute and did not seem to give the article much traction, so we have taken the unusual step of changing it to the present, more descriptive title. The URL remains the same. </i></p>
<p><br />
Ken Ham, on a YouTube video entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/1aGZoJCdCpo?si=8iLpBwawPiOYOYbE">Here’s What People NEED to Realize about Kamala Harris</a>” and specifically credited to Answers in Genesis, explicitly attacks Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris for her views on abortion and other matters. The video received around 150,000 views in a day or so. AIG writes,</p>

<blockquote><p>"In this short video, Ken Ham speaks on the recent political ideologies of Kamala, sharing his perspective on them as a Bible-believing Christian." [Note how he infantilizes her by using her first name only.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Our colleague Dan Phelps, who sent us this link, asks, “How is AIG, a ministry, still tax exempt?” He notes that AIG’s shell company, Ark Encounter, gets $1.825 million per year in sales tax rebates from Kentucky Tourism and is advertised for free by the taxpayer-supported “Kentucky Faith Trail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps suggests that you can complain to the IRS using <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf">Form 13909, Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint (Referral)</a>. It is not clear whether the IRS will take any action, but a few complaints cannot hurt. AIG’s street address is Answers in Genesis, 2800 Bullittsburg Church Rd., Petersburg, KY 41080, and their EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is 33-0596423.  You need to send a cover letter along with the form, but both may be e-mailed to the address at the bottom of page 1.</p>

<p>The IRS form asks you for “Who/What/Where/When/How you learned about and obtained the information in this report.” I do not know precisely what approach to take, beyond that Mr. Ham runs a tax-exempt religious organization, which he considers a ministry, and in this video he is implicitly campaigning against Kamala Harris. Perhaps this line of reasoning can be fleshed out in the comments to this post. The URL of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGZoJCdCpo.</p>

<p>In case you have the illusion that Mr. Ham is not electioneering, I can assure you that his minions think otherwise. Consider, for example, these (admittedly cherry-picked) comments:</p>

In this photo, geologists are examining fluorescent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite">calcite</a> and other minerals using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> "black-light."  This particular light is optimized for mineral identification by selectively emitting two different wavelengths of light (UV-A, 365&nbsp;nm, and UV-C, 245&nbsp;nm), while filtering out all of the visible light. Everything  in this photo is either fluorescing or illuminated from the emitted light of the fluorescent minerals. Recent studies suggest that this cave passage has remained little changed for the past 12 million years."

<p>Who knew? I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, the inability to visualize things. Well, probably not fully fledged aphantasia, but certainly <i>dys</i>phantasia. Aphantasia is a word I first learned on listening to an NPR program with a somewhat lengthy title, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/26/1198910315/face-blindness-prosopagnosia-memory-aphantasia-sight-imagination">The human brain is hardwired to recognize faces. But what if you can’t?</a> It turns out that Sadie  Dingfelder, the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316545147/">Do I Know You? A Faceblind Reporter’s Journey into the Science of Sight, Memory, and Imagination</a>, can’t. Recognize faces, that is.</p>

<p>Ms. Dingfelder is not only face blind; she is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoblindness">stereo blind</a> and aphantasic. Now, I understand that freshman psychology students think they suffer from every affliction they study, but I was surprised to find that I have some degree of all of those.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 1st of August, was the 280th anniversary of the birth of Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine 
de Monet, who was the Chevalier de Lamarck.  As I have noted each year here, he was, 
as far as I am concerned, the first evolutionary biologist.  He had a (wrong) mechanism 
that would explain adaptation, and was the major pioneer in drawing evolutionary 
trees.  He was also a pioneer of invertebrate biology.  (Although he made use of 
inheritance of acquired characters in his mechanisms, he did not invent that idea, 
as most folks already believed that).</p>

<p>This time I want to note the way Lamarck is commemorated in the name of a street 
in Paris, the Rue de Lamarck.  His name is also on streets in some other French cities. 
The explanation that I have heard of why that particular street was named after him 
is that it was being built about the time that Darwin was becoming famous, and the 
French found a then-almost-forgotten French biologist to commemorate, to compete with 
Darwin.  So they named a street for him in an area where new streets were being built and named.  I don’t know whether this is really an accurate explanation.</p>

<p>The Rue de Lamarck is famous in Paris today as it gives its name to a major Metro 
stop, Lamarck-Coulaincourt.  Above you will see the very dramatic entrance to 
that Metro station, photographed from the Rue de Lamarck.  The entrance is between 
two stairways.</p>

<p>Happy 280th, Jean-Baptiste!</p>
