<p>Darwin Day, that is, the anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth in 1809, is February 12. If you are sponsoring any Darwin Day events, or indeed if you know of any, please submit them to <a href="https://darwinday.org/">International Darwin Day</a>. As I write, only a half-dozen events are listed, and I am sure that there are many more.</p>

        <p>The ever-vigilant Dan Phelps has sent us a couple of links from West Virginia, where their Senate education committee <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/senate-education-committee-approves-intelligent-design-in-curriculum-national-motto-display-in-schools-and-adjusted/article_fd8cd01e-b49b-11ee-88d8-4fdacea07ccf.html">approved a bill</a> that would allow the teaching of intelligent-design creationism in the public schools. The WV News noted that</p>

<blockquote><p>The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics.</p>

<p>The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. </p></blockquote>

<p>Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom.</p>

<p>According to WV Public Broadcasting, <a href="https://wvpublic.org/lawmakers-hear-support-for-intelligent-design-in-public-schools/">two high school students</a>, Haden Hodge and Hunter Bernard, argued that intelligent-design creationism is not a religious argument. Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design</p>

<blockquote>is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument.</blockquote>

<p>Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did.</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps, who is from Kentucky and has been fighting this kind of nonsense for years, adds, “Let us hope that this doesn’t spread to Kentucky; our legislature would fall for ID creationism very quickly.”</p>

        <p>At the start of this year, Answers in Genesis completed moving their K-12 Answers Academy school into the $31 million former Toyota USA Headquarters building in northern Kentucky. Where they received to money to purchase the building has been a bit of a mystery, considering the lackluster ticket sales at the Ark Encounter. Today I discovered <a href="https://readlion.com/answers-academy-celebrates-new-facility-expanded-enrollment/">this story</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, The Herzog Foundation bankrolled some of the renovations that made the school’s present location possible. The article says: “The school renovations were made possible in part by a grant from The Herzog Foundation, which publishes The Lion.”</p>

<p>A further search about The Herzog Foundation brings up <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/08/dark-money-group-pushing-woke-heat-maps-targeting-schools-has-ties-to-christian-education-foundation/">this article</a>, which shows the Herzog Foundation is associated with several extremist far-right groups funneling dark money into so-called “anti-woke” schools.</p>

<p>AIG may have numerous dark money groups financing the Ark, Creation Museum, and their other activities, while simultaneously receiving $1.825 million a year as sales tax rebate incentives from the Kentucky Tourism Cabinet.</p>

<p>Lionel Dahmer, the father of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer – the "<a href="https://www.biography.com/crime/jeffrey-dahmer">Milwaukee Monster</a>" who killed and dismembered 17 men and boys (mostly African Americans) – died on December 5, 2023. Lionel was the author of <a href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781635615630">A Father's Story</a>, a memoir of his son's youth first published in 1994. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/us/lionel-dahmer-dead.html">obituary</a> in <i>The New York Times</i>, "Mr. Dahmer described himself in his book as ‘almost totally analytical'—a chemist, comforted by the scientific predictability of his work, whose emotional life resembled a ‘broad, flat plain.'" But in fact, Lionel underwent a conversion experience in 1989 that affected not only his conception of the relation between religion and science, but also how his son is remembered.</p>
