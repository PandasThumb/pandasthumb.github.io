<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 1st of August, is the 280th anniversary of the birth of Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine 
de Monet, who was the Chevalier de Lamarck.  As I have noted each year here, he was, 
as far as I am concerned, the first evolutionary biologist.  He had a (wrong) mechanism 
that would explain adaptation, and was the major pioneer in drawing evolutionary 
trees.  He was also a pioneer of invertebrate biology.  (Although he made use of 
inheritance of acquired characters in his mechanisms, he did not invent that idea, 
as most folks already believed that).</p>

<p>This time I want to note the way Lamarck is comemmorated in the name of a street 
in Paris, the Rue de Lamarck.  His name is also on streets in some other French cities. 
The explanation that I have heard of why that particular street was named after him 
is that it was being built about the time that Darwin was becoming famous, and the 
French found a then-almost-forgotten French biologist to commemmorate, to compete with 
Darwin.  So they named a street for him in an area where new streets were being built and named.  I don’t know whether this is really an accurate explanation.</p>

<p>The Rue de Lamarck is famous in Paris today as it gives its name to a major Metro 
stop, Lamarck-Coulaincourt.  Above you will see the very dramatic entrance to 
that Metro station, photographed from the Rue de Lamarck.  The entrance is between 
two stairways.</p>

<p>Happy 280th, Jean-Baptiste!</p>

<p>H. Holden Thorpe, the editor of <i>Science</i> magazine, ran an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr8867">editorial<a> this week on institutional neutrality, the idea, as he put it, “that universities in the United States—and especially their presidents—should be politically neutral….” I would add to that the idea that departments and especially their heads should be politically neutral. The editorial is short  and open access, so I think you can read it for yourselves, but he invokes the <a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/KalvenRprt_0.pdf"> Kalven Report</a>, a mercifully equally short document from the University of Chicago, which declared a “heavy presumption” against universities expressing opinions on political issues or modifying their investments in order to “foster social or political values, however compelling and appealing they may be.”</a></a></p>

<p>Hardly any universities have adopted the Kalven Report as policy, though I gather that a few have adopted the less-stringent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_principles">Chicago principles</a>. Since the war in Gaza, there has been pressure to adopt the Kalven principles, according to Thorpe. For a crash course in the latest activity regarding Kalven or the Chicago principles, see Jerry Coyne’s blog, Why Evolution Is True, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/category/kalven-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thorpe is less of an absolutist regarding Kalven than is Coyne, though he agrees that universities need to be neutral regarding matters of opinion. He draws a distinction, however, between matters of opinion and matters of fact:</p>

<blockquote> But what about matters of science, especially when a finding has powerful political implications such as studies on climate or vaccines? Where should universities draw the line?</blockquote>

<p>Or evolution. Several people told Thorpe that universities must keep strictly away from commenting on any research whatsoever, except to support the right of the researcher to publish that research. Another, Eric Topol, told him that such a stance is “spineless” and appears to dissociate the university from its faculty and their published science.</p>

<p>Thorpe himself seems somewhat conflicted, and I can understand why, but he expresses concern that</p>

<blockquote> Stanford University just shut down its disinformation research program after it was hit by lawsuits from conservative groups.… [T]here is a danger that universities will shirk their responsibility to stand up not for any particular finding but for a more overriding principle—the importance of independent scholarship. </blockquote>

<p>Our colleague Dan Phelps, vigilant as usual, has just sent us</p>

<blockquote><p>[a] nice video by Dr. <a href="https://joelduff.org/">Joel Duff</a> about collecting fossils at outcrops adjacent to the Ark Park. I was at these outcrops several years ago and found mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryozoa">bryozoa</a> from the Upper Ordovician Kope Formation. The creationist “scientists” at the Ark seem oblivious to the existence of these fossils that don’t jibe with creationist Flood geology.</p>

<p>Dr. Duff also discusses the grift AiG does of selling bags of fossils in dirt for exorbitant prices (up to $55 a bag for kids to wash out in a fake mining sluice!). This method is obviously not how fossils are typically unearthed, but the kids and parents buying this product wouldn’t be likely to know better. The Ark apparently purchases their fossils from other parts of the world, while not taking advantage of their local abundant fossils.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Phelps expresses the hope that Dr. Duff does not give the Ark Park any ideas. Well, he does:</p>

<p><i>Andrew J Petto is Distinguished Lecturer Emeritus in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, where he taught anatomy and physiology, human gross anatomy, and kinesiology courses. He is a bioanthropologist with a concentration on primate functional morphology. His latest book, as a co-author with Alice Beck Kehoe, is <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003226819/humans-alice-beck-kehoe-andrew-petto">Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology</a>, 2nd ed. New York: Routledge. 2022 (Dec).</i></p>

<p>The story of <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> is the story of the emergence of the human evolutionary branch from the last common ancestor of the African ape clades (evolutionary branches): humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. It is a story of transitions. To understand the importance of <i>Sahelanthropus</i> in reconstructing human evolutionary history, we could paraphrase Dobzhansky’s famous quotation: “Nothing in <i>Sahelanthropus</i> biology makes sense except in the light of evolutionary transition” (Dobzhansky 1973).</p>

<p>Since its discovery in 2001, <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i>  has intrigued scientists (Brunet et al. 2002). Nicknamed “Toumai” which means “hope of life” in the local language, it is (so far) the oldest fossil on our human evolutionary branch, and it is very close to the time when this evolutionary branch separated from the last common ancestor with the other African great apes.</p>
