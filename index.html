<p>Our colleague Nathan Lents has just posted a series of videos, <a href="https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2023/09/09/some-interviews-on-our-poorly-designed-bodies/">Some interviews on our poorly designed bodies</a>. Lents, a biology professor at John Jay College, is the author of the book <a href="https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/book-human-errors/">Human Errors</a> and is an expert on poor design. So far, I have watched only the video on “Why the Human Eye Is a Design Disaster” and noted the comparison with the cephalopod eye. All I can add is that, in addition, cephalopods cannot get dry eyes.</p>

<p>I saw these dragonflies on the trail in the vicinity of Wonderland Lake, just begging to be photographed. The picture above is the band-winged meadowhawk, as demonstrated by the brown bands on the wings. When I examined the photographs, I found that not all meadowhawks are alike. Below the fold, a dragonfly that to my eye looks identical, except that its wings do not display the brown, translucent bands.</p>

Ms. Susek notes, "When I came out to the car park  there was a lovely double rainbow that appeared to end just over my car." The photograph shows that the sky is brighter inside the primary arc and, less clearly, outside the secondary arc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ID advocacy site <em>Evolution News</em> has had a series of posts by the physicist 
Eric Hedin.  The theme has been that adaptive information in biological organisms info
cannot have been produced by natural processes, because these always degrade information. 
Hedin is a well-trained physicist.  He is currently the Professor of Physics and Astronomy 
and the Chair of the Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering at Biola University, 
and he trained in plasma physics at my own university.</p>

<p>With that strong background in physics, we should be able to rely on his statements about 
the increase of the amount of biological information which is possible 
owing to ordinary physical and biological processes.  Here’s what his says 
at one point in <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/05/is-life-an-information-ratchet/">this recent post at Evolution News</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could a natural information ratchet exist? Since our goal is to understand whether life is an information ratchet, we first need to examine what kind of mechanism might be required to cause a living system to ratchet up its information content over time. To increase information means to select outcomes that correspond to a greater level of functional or meaningful complexity. The only way for this to happen is if the selection mechanism (in other words, the ratchet) is designed to produce the target outcome, and this means that the mechanism must already contain the information specifying the target. A physical mechanism cannot produce any information beyond what it already contains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have complained <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/22/09/badinformation.html">in a previous post</a> about 
his statements about conservation of information and about there being no 
natural process that can account for the information accumulated in 
living things.  Here it is again.</p>

<p>Can it be that Professor Hedin has got his basic science wrong?  Say it ain’t so!</p>

<p>To a physicist who is (barely) old enough to remember the controversy over Oppenheimer’s security clearance and who would also recognize most of the characters, the movie <i>Oppenheimer</i> was fascinating: one of the shortest 3-h movies I have ever seen. I gather, however, that it was somewhat less fascinating to the wife of such a physicist, who found the plot hard to follow and the characters too numerous to keep track of. I cannot entirely disagree: possibly I followed the plot and distinguished most of the characters because I knew them in advance.</p>

<p>The movie follows the physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer"> J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> from his beginning as a graduate student in Europe through his bringing quantum mechanics from Europe to the US to his shepherding of the Manhattan Project until his disgrace at the hands of the Atomic Energy Commission. Considering how they treated him, at least in the movie, I was surprised that they did not take his sword, break it over their knee, and send him off to Devil’s Island.</p>
