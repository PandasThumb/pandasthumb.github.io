<p>This Kitzmas was different. For the first time, the Discovery Institute allowed the anniversary of 
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District to pass without complaining about the verdict. Perhaps 
they are hoping that we will forget about the incredible badness of the text that they were 
trying to foist on the District’s students. <em>Of Pandas and People</em> is carefully constructed to 
be as misleading as possible, and we shouldn’t let them forget this, as long as contributors 
and advisers responsible for it remain in position within the Discovery Institute<sup>1</sup>, while 
the Institute continues to promote  works such as Denton’s <a href="https://www.discovery.org/v/legacy-of-evolution/?hilite=theory+crisis"><em>Evolution – A Theory in Crisis</em></a>, 
that perpetuate the same elementary errors of logic.  But first, an apparent digression.  When 
students first come across the use of molecular or DNA sequencing in constructing phylogenetic 
trees, they are sometimes puzzled. They have been told that mammals are descended from fish by 
way of amphibians. Therefore, as a matter of common sense, they might expect that frogs should 
be closer to fish in evolutionary terms than we are. This is another example of the Evolution 
as Progress error. While amniotes have progressed through synapsid to mammal to humans, the 
pinnacle of creation, the frog has remained a lowly frog and should, therefore, be closer to 
the common ancestor, as if the ineluctable processes of molecular mutation had somehow been 
suspended.  We might call this the “frozen frog fallacy.”</p>

<p>At this point, a Table like the one shown below might help:</p>

        <p>I consider a miracle to be something that I understand in some detail and know it is impossible, yet there it is in my hand for $200 – a digital camera, for example. I do not understand the James Webb Space Telescope in nearly as much detail, but I still consider it a miracle. <i>Science</i> may not agree with my definition of a miracle, but they consider the telescope the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2022">Breakthrough of the Year</a>. Hard to argue with: the telescope itself is absolutely remarkable, as are some of the images it has returned.</p>

<p><i>Science</i>’s runners-up include perennial rice, the new-found creativity of artificial intelligence, deflection of an asteroid, two advances in virology – a nascent RSV vaccine and the discovery that multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus – and several others. What they call “Breakdowns” are fewer: the fact that zero Covid no longer works (if it ever did), the fact that science ties between nations are “fraying,” and the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions owing to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Answers in Genesis posted a <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/science/year-review-top-science-news-2022/">Year in Review</a>, by Troy Lacey, which they arranged chronologically by month, rather than in order of importance. A few comments below the fold.</p>

It sits behind an insulated Roman shade known as a Warm Window, so it gets very cold near the bottom. The hills are a few millimeters across and melt very quickly once the shade is pulled up.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we are at the last day of 2022, the newspapers are full of accounts of what happened in 2022.  Even the Discovery Institute has bragged, at its site <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/12/the-year-in-review-intelligent-design-grows-in-influence-and-depth/">Evolution News &amp; Science Today</a>
how much the cause of Intelligent Design advanced in the last year.  This account, by Brian Miller, was mocked by critics of ID (e.g. <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/30/the-enduring-futility-of-intelligent-design-creationism/">here</a>, <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/id-achievements-of-the-year/15635">here</a>, and <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/01/01/follow-up-on-id-at-conferences/">here</a>).</p>

<p>It is hard to come up with lists of things that happened in 2022.  But much easier to make lists of things that didn’t happen.  I wondered: what are the major things 
that <em>didn’t</em> happen in 2022?  Particularly with regard to arguments for Intelligent Design.</p>

<p>I’ll provide my suggested non-event.   It is the clarification of how the Algorithmic Complexity argument for Intelligent Design works.  It remains, as it has been 
for some years, basically unexplained.  A reading of the whole course of argument using Specified Complexity, from William Dembski’s book <em>The Design Inference</em> on, 
shows that the algorithmic complexity calculation started out as a peripheral suggestion and gradually changed until it is now said to be central to that 
argument.  But in the course of these changes, the logic of the criterion became no clearer.</p>

<p>Some time ago I puzzled over this <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html">perhaps at too great a length</a> in a post here at Panda’s Thumb.  Was the algorithm supposed to compute the genotype?  the phenotype? 
Why was observation that it was nonrandomly un-complex supposed to favor ID?  How did the probability distribution of algorithms that was used make biological sense?</p>

<p>Another year has passed, and none of these questions have been answered.  So I nominate this non-event as the greatest non-achievement of Intelligent Design proponents 
in 2022.  I congratulate them.  But our readers may have other non-achievements to suggest.  Let’s hear from them.</p>

<p>Jerry Coyne on his blog today advises us to <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/29/take-the-faraday-institutes-science-vs-religion-quiz/">Take the Faraday Institute’s Science vs. Religion quiz!</a> So I did! <a href="https://www.sciencereligioncompass.org/">(Here.)</a></p>

<p>You may see my result to the left. I ended up in the fourth quadrant, relatively close to the y-axis. The axis labels are to some extent jargon: Functional means that religion is best at social activities, what Dr. Coyne and I would call “tikkun olam,” or “repairing the world.” Substantive, by contrast, means that religion has meaning or content. The terms on the x-axis are reasonably clear, but I consider scientism to be pejorative and wish they had found a better term. (I have more than once been accused of scientism and am somewhat gratified that I did not land farther to the right.)</p>

<p>Here is what the quiz makers said about me, and it is fairly accurate:</p>
