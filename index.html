</figure>

<p>One way to learn about the activities of a non-profit organization is to obtain copies of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_990">IRS Form 990</a>. As a critic of young earth creationism in Kentucky, I am always anxious to view the latest Form 990 of Answers in Genesis (AIG), Ark Encounter, and Twelve Stones Christian Academy. These organizations are non-profits that promote creationism in Kentucky and are part of Ken Ham’s Answers in Genesis empire. One can also glean other information from these forms about for-profit shell companies under the AIG umbrella and businesses associated with AIG. Usually, information from IRS Form 990’s is more than a year old and available for free (you need to create an account) from <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar</a>, as well as other organizations. For the last year, the most recent Form 990 for AIG, et al. at Guidestar were for the year ending June 2020. Thus, I looked at the forms at <a href="https://www.propublica.org/">Propublica</a>. The latest Form 990’s available at Propublica are for the fiscal year ending in June 2021 and were submitted to the IRS in May, 2022. Links to all three forms are given at the end of this document, in case you want to go look for yourself. Presumably, forms concerning the year ending June, 2022 have been submitted this year, but may not be available for quite some time.</p>

<p>There are interesting, frightening, sad, and sometimes humorous items in these forms describing Answers in Genesis’s (and AIG shell companies’) metastasis in Kentucky. Understanding the meaning of the Form 990’s by AIG, Crosswater Canyon, and Twelve Stones Christian Academy is complicated by the odd arrangement of non-profit and for-profit shell companies under the umbrella of Answers in Genesis. I should point out that I am neither a lawyer or an accountant. Someone familiar with non-profit tax law is needed to review these documents in detail (if you are a CPA or otherwise qualified, please volunteer!).</p>

<p>Dan Phelps was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1d-DG0N1LU"> interviewed at length</a> about his opposition to the Ark Park and other Answers in Genesis shenanigans, on a program called Captive Desk by David Murray. The interview lasted nearly an hour and a half, and covered geology, paleontology, and pseudoscience, in addition to AIG. As Mr. Murray details in his introduction, Mr. Phelps has had a remarkably productive career, aside from his day job. Watch the interview!</p>

<figcaption>BOX SCOUT/No. 2/<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Seneca"> SENECA CAMERA MANUFACTURING COMPANY</a>/Rochester New York USA. The camera has what looks like a landscape lens and precisely 2 shutter speeds: 1/30&nbsp;s or thereabouts, and time. It uses Kodak 120 roll film with a 2-1/4 by 3-1/4&nbsp;in format. Roll film, for the uninitiated, is a layer of film and a layer of paper wrapped around a cylinder of wood or metal. The layer of paper is still in the camera and advises the user to use Kodak Velox paper "for quality." According to a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/787758589/vintage-camera-seneca-scout-2a-box"> not necessarily reliable source</a>, model 2A was manufactured between 1913 and 1920. The 2A, to my surprise, had an <a href="https://www.pacificrimcamera.com/rl/02396/02396.pdf">achromatic lens</a>. I do not know when the model 2 was manufactured.</figcaption>

<p>Last year, I had major surgery in early July and elected not to run the XIII-th photography contest. I think we can manage one this year. It will begin Monday, June 19, at noon Mountain Daylight Time. I will post the rules then, but they will be substantially the same as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/06/photography-contest-xiii.html">two years ago</a>, which means we will accept entries until July 5. We will limit you to 3 photos per person, and I think we will have no special themes or categories, unless I get an inspiration in the next couple of weeks. We will display the finalists and open voting for the winner on July 10, close voting on July 21, and announce the winner on July 24. More on June 19!</p>

It seemed kind of late in the season, but these doves were acting kind of, well, lovey-dovey, so I pruriently snapped their picture. The collared doves have colonized the city, and (as I have noted earlier) I no longer see nor hear mourning doves, <i>Zenaida macroura</i>, within the city limits.

<p>Answers in Genesis (AiG) published a <a href="https://answersresearchjournal.org/noahs-flood/heat-problems-flood-models-4/">new paper</a> yesterday in their <i>Answers Research Journal</i> discussing how life on earth survived the massive amount of heat produced in volcanic eruptions and intrusions during “The Flood.” The paper was authored by Dr. <a href="https://creation.com/bill-worraker">William Worraker</a>, a British creationist with a doctorate in mathematics and a BS in physics. To their credit, the creationists realize having the Paleozoic-to-Recent igneous rock record go from molten to crystallizing in the last few thousand years presents a big problem for Young Earth Creationism.</p>

<p>As usual for <i>Answers Research Journal</i>, it is difficult to determine who the paper is aimed at or how it was peer reviewed by any competent scientist in the fields the paper discusses. Lots of technical articles from real journals and several mathematical appendices are cited, but then there is a section of definitions taken from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> that include basic information that an undergraduate chemistry student should be aware of, as well as descriptions of minerals at an undergraduate mineralogy class level. This paper doesn’t appear to be written with the intent of convincing a geophysicist or geoscientist studying tectonics. In reality, it seems written to impress non-scientists, including potential donors to AiG, by being “sciencey.” Much of what is put out by AiG, the Institute for Creation Research, and other creationists that looks technical is really just a parody of science, meant to impress their followers/donors.</p>

<p>The abstract mentions supernatural explanations, but most of the paper doesn’t do so until the concluding portion. After paragraphs of rather questionable reasoning, special pleading, attempts at physics, and creation “science,” the author finally comes clean with this total <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/02/on-bullshit.html">bullshit</a> by claiming the Bible says it and God did it:</p>

<blockquote>However, it is important to appreciate that our inability to identify an acknowledged mechanism for removing the excess heat deposited during and after the Flood, an issue first identified over 35 years ago (Baumgardner 1986), is only a problem in the sense that it represents the limited nature of our human understanding. In a biblical context there is no fundamental problem because God purposely brought about the Flood (Genesis 6:17) as a judgment on the wicked human race of Noah’s day and covenanted with Noah to preserve human and animal life through the cataclysm (Genesis 6:18). He sovereignly accomplished both objectives, implying that environmental temperatures could not have risen beyond biological endurance limits. The only real problem is our current lack of understanding of how this was accomplished; the Flood account in Genesis 6–9 does not tell us directly whether supernatural processes were involved, though it seems very likely that they were. The same basic issue arises in connection with the topics to be covered in Parts 5 (heat due to Accelerated Nuclear Decay) and 6 (heat due to bombardments from space) of this series, and will be considered at greater length in Part 7.</blockquote>

<p>The author could have saved a great deal of time if he had just said a miracle occurred rather than subjecting the reader to all of the arm waving and special pleading.</p>
