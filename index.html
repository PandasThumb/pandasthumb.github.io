<p>Two weeks ago, someone pen-named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ululodes">Ulolodes</a>, which I now know is a genus of owl fly, requested more spider pictures. I do not have a whole lot, but here is a snapshot I took this summer of a spider, which I think is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulate_cobweb_spider"><i>Steatoda triangulosa</i></a> – triangular cobweb spider – dining on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduvius_personatus"><i>Reduvius personatus</i></a> – assassin bug.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since at least May, 2024, the Creation Museum and Ken Ham have been discussing a new display, meant to describe the dinosaur <em>Protoceratops</em> being drowned in the Biblical Flood of Noah (see for example <a href="https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/">https://creationmuseum.org/blog/2024/05/24/new-dinosaur-exhibit-coming-to-creation-museum/</a> and <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/">https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2024/07/14/most-detailed-protoceratops-world/</a>). This display finally opened in late October, 2024. Figure 1 is the original mock-up of this ridiculous display from Ken Ham’s blog. Pictures of the display are available on several Answers in Genesis’ and Ken Ham’s social media pages. Long (2024) describes the artwork going into this new display. Although the artwork depicting the dinosaur itself is excellent, the display has absurd, inaccurate, misleading, and dishonest information on the depositional environment of the surrounding sediment and the taphonomy of <em>Protoceratops</em> and other Cretaceous vertebrate fossils of Mongolia.</p>

<p>The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, both owned by the Young Earth Creationistministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), espouse that the fossil record is a result of Noah’s Flood which occurred in 2348 BC. All employees of AiG must sign off on a “Statement of Faith” (<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/">https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/</a>), that states in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and catastrophic in its effects. At one stage during the flood, the waters covered the entire surface of the whole globe with no land surface being exposed anywhere—the flood of Noah is not to be understood as any form of local or regional flood. The Noachian flood was a significant geological event, and most fossiliferous sediments were deposited at that time (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%207.19%E2%80%9320">Genesis 7:19–20</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Pet%203.5%E2%80%937">2 Peter 3:5–7</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/whats-the-best-proof-of-creation/">evidence is always subject to interpretation</a> by fallible people who do not possess all information (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Num%2023.19">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Sam%2022.31">2 Samuel 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2018.30">Psalm 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2046.9%E2%80%9310">Isaiah 46:9–10</a>, <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isaiah%2055.9">55:9</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%203.4">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Tim%203.16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this ends any attempt at science by AiG employees and replaces geology, paleontology, and all other science and history with unchanging religious dogma.</p>

<p>Because of their weird dogma, AiG has an unusual take on dinosaurs and other prehistoric life forms. Both the Ark and Creation Museum have problematic displays on dinosaurs. In dioramas, dinosaurs are depicted as living with people, among ancient buildings, in stalls on Noah’s Ark, and most amazingly, fighting with humans and giants in a pre-Flood arena of death (see Figure 3 below). The Creation Museum has a actual skeleton of the dinosaur <em>Allosaurus</em> on display that was donated by white nationalist and neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka (see: <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/">https://rightingamerica.net/dinosaur-bones-mark-meadows-neo-confederates-and-the-tawdry-world-of-young-earth-creationism/</a>). This <em>Allosaurus</em> skeleton is depicted as drowning in Noah’s Flood in 2348 BC.</p>

<p><i>The following is a review of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lie-Unraveling-Evolution-Millions-Years-ebook/dp/B0DD4YLQRQ/">The Lie</a>, by Ken Ham (Master Book, 2024), and a comparison of the 1987, 2012, and 2024 editions. A longer article appeared <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2024/10/reviewed-ken-hams-the-lie-unravelling-the-myth-of-evolution-millions-of-years-and-why-we-need-to-pay-attention.html">here</a> in 3 Quarks Daily.</i></p>

<p>Let me first remind you of the scale of Ken Ham’s political significance. He has among his friends Mike Johnson, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, whose law firm has represented AiG pro bono. And among the contributors to its magazine is Calvin Beisner, director of the Cornwall Alliance, whose entire purpose is to deny the importance of human-caused climate change. Cornwall in turn has direct links to the Heartland Institute and to the Heritage Foundation, authors of Project 2025.</p>
<p>Readers here will be familiar with the destructive and anti-scientific approach of the modern creationist movement in the US. But that’s only half the story. It is not only about the beginning of the world, but about its ending. Genesis is pivotal, but so is Revelation. So are the many hints of the end of the world that are explicit in the New Testament, and can be discovered with sufficient ingenuity in the Old.</p>
<p>Such thinking underlines the apocalyptic tone, repeatedly echoed in AiG’s material, that underlies current US right-wing politics. If the Earth does not have a deep past, we cannot expect it to have a prolonged future. We should not be concerning ourselves with conservation, but with righteousness. This perspective has political implications, and comparing the 1987 and 2024 versions of <i>The Lie</i> shows the political aspect becoming increasingly explicit. Otherwise, there is not much difference between the two editions, though The third edition is more repetitious and, where direct comparison is possible, less vigorous in its use of language, and more hectoring, than the original.</p>

<p>I found this spider trapped in a porcelain sink from which it could not climb out, so I naturally snapped a few pictures. The people at <a href="https://bugguide.net">Bugguide</a> classified it as a member of the family Gnaphosidae. They warned me that Google Lens is not good at spiders, but, just for fun, I asked. Among the first hits was my very own picture of this very spider <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/2379696">here</a>.</p>

<p>I found this spider inside the house the other day and managed to get a picture showing the 8 eyes. In case you were wondering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F"> what it is like to be a bat</a>, think about what it must be like to be a spider.</p>

<p>Spiders have simple eyes, as opposed to compound eyes like those of a dragonfly. Because the eyes are so small, they cannot have good resolution: Even if the eyes were diffraction-limited, their sensors would have to be roughly the same size as the cones in human eyes, for example, and there would be many fewer of them. (In photographic terms, all diffraction-limited F/4 lenses have the same resolution limit, but a longer focal-length lens affords more detail. <a href="https://www.phys.ufl.edu/courses/phy3221/spring10/HaldaneRightSize.pdf">This paper</a> by Haldane notes that an eye is not very good until it reaches a certain size, but a colleague of mine has just pointed out that context matters and the spider does not need a better eye.)</p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_vision">spider vision </a>, the two central eyes in the lower bank are the <i>principal eyes</i>, and they do their best to form an image, but the pixels (if you will) are nowhere near the focal point. The spider is thus dreadfully nearsighted, though he must get some imaging due to the depth of field. The other, <i>secondary</i> eyes are used for light and motion detection, and, for example, polarization detection.</p>
