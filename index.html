<p>This post is an unashamed plug for the book <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/mns/news-and-publications/chakrabarty_evolution.pdf">Nature Selecting</a>, subtitled “A children’s book explaining evolution,” by Prosanta Chakrabarty, professor of biology and curator of fish at Louisiana State University, and illustrated by Anjai Noël, who just graduated from Sherwood Middle School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is Prof. Chakrabarty’s 14-year-old daughter. The book cover, left, shows one of Ms. Noël’s delightful illustrations. Prof. Chakrabarty is also the author of the 2023 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explaining-through-Evolution-Prosanta-Chakrabarty/dp/0262546256/">Explaining Life through Evolution</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the present work, Nature Selecting, is available only as a PDF and at no cost. It is worth much more than that, and I hope they will eventually print it on paper.</p>

<p>Thanks to Michael Zimmerman and the <a href="https://www.theclergyletterproject.org/">Clergy Letter Project</a> for alerting us to this publication.</p>

<p>The full title of this article by William Trollinger and Susan Trollinger is <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/1-in-4-americans-reject-evolution-a-century-after-the-scopes-monkey-trial-spotlighted-the-clash-between-science-and-religion/">1 in 4 Americans Reject Evolution, A Century after the Scopes Monkey Trial Spotlighted the Clash between Science and Religion</a>.</p>

<p>Trollinger and Trollinger give a brief outline of the trial and some of its antecedents; what happened at the trial is comparatively well known, and you can read it for yourself. They point out, in particular, that Clarence Darrow’s famed (or perhaps notorious) “interrogation” of William Jennings Bryan made it obvious that a literal reading of the six-day creation myth in Genesis 1-2 was incompatible with modern science. Additionally, news stories, particularly by H.L. Mencken, portrayed religious fundamentalists as ignorant fools and led many to believe that such biblical literalism would soon disappear. It did not, though I think you could say it went underground for some time.</p>

<p>The fundamentalists, note Trollinger and Trollinger, needed scientific evidence to support their belief in a young earth. In 1961, they found it in <a href="https://www.prpbooks.com/book/genesis-flood-the">The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications</a> (the link is to a 50th anniversary edition published by P&amp;R [Presbyterian and Reformed] Publishing).</p>

<p>Trollinger and Trollinger note that today approximately one-quarter of all Americans are young-earth creationists and reject much of modern biology and modern geology, not to mention modern cosmology. Answers in Genesis, which is strictly YEC, is now the world’s largest creationist organization. We report occasionally on AIG’s Ark Park, most recently <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2025/03/state-police-proselytized.html">here</a>, so I will not dwell on it. Trollinger and Trollinger note that the Ark Park and other museums such as the Creation Museum attract millions of visitors.</p>

<p>Worse, though, they point to “an ever-expanding network of fundamentalist schools and homeschools that present young Earth creationism as true science.” Yet more worse, they say that at least 15 states have school choice programs which use tax money to pay for private and home schools. I would add only that these private schools take scarce funds from public schools that need them badly.</p>

<p>Young-earth creationism is not dead; it is not even sick (OK, it <i>is</i> sick, but it is not at death’s door). With a little help from old-earth creationisms, not least intelligent-design creationism, creationism writ large may be <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/01/is-intelligent-design.html">making a comeback</a>.</p>

<p><i> Glenn Branch is deputy director of the <a href="https://ncse.ngo/">National Center for Science Education</a>, a nonprofit organization that defends the integrity of American science education against ideological interference. He is the author of numerous articles on evolution education and climate education, and obstacles to them, in such publications as </i>Scientific American, American Educator, The American Biology Teacher, <i>and the </i>Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics; <i>and the co-editor, with Eugenie C. Scott, of </i>Not in Our Classrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools (2006). <i>He received the Evolution Education Award for 2020 from the National Association of Biology Teachers. </i></p>

<p>In 1925, a young teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, was convicted of violating a state law that forbade the state’s educators “to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” Especially now, as its centennial year is being commemorated in various ways across the nation, the Scopes “monkey” trial is widely known. But the details of a similar controversy in New Mexico three years earlier deserve to be remembered as well.</p>

<p>Famously, the antievolution crusade of the 1920s was launched by William Jennings Bryan, a politician of national stature, who began to encourage the passage of bans on the teaching of evolution at both the state and the local level early in the decade. Probably as a result, in the summer of 1922, the school board in Fort Sumner, New Mexico — perhaps most famous as the site where the outlaw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid">Billy the Kid</a> was shot and killed — adopted a resolution forbidding the teaching of evolution in the town’s schools, and calling for the resignation of any offending teacher.</p>

<p>Fort Sumner’s superintendent of schools, F. E. (for Finis Ewing: he was evidently named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finis_Ewing">founder</a> of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church) Dean, was summering in his home state of Missouri when he received a copy of the resolution. He decided that it would not be useful to argue about the resolution at a distance, planning instead on his return to Fort Sumner to argue in person to the board that “I had not been teaching the…doctrine of evolution in the form attributed to me” and moreover to explain that the antievolution resolution was unworkable.</p>

        <p>Here are the finalists of the 2025 photography contest. It was nice to see some old friends, though new names would have been welcome. With assistance from Our Wife and Harshest Critic, we chose 7, which we display below the Figurative Fold. We chose the photographs more on the basis of their pictorial quality than on their scientific interest. Any text submitted by the photographers has been omitted.</p>

<p>The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close Sunday, July 6 (the 4th being a holiday in the US), at approximately noon MDT, and we will display the winner at noon Monday, July 7.</p>

<p>Please remember that this is a photography contest, not a popularity contest, and discourage your friends from enlisting others specifically to vote for you.</p>
