<figcaption>BOX SCOUT/No. 2/<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Seneca"> SENECA CAMERA MANUFACTURING COMPANY</a>/Rochester New York USA. The camera has what looks like a landscape lens and precisely 2 shutter speeds: 1/30&nbsp;s or thereabouts, and time. It uses Kodak 120 roll film with a 2-1/4 by 3-1/4&nbsp;in format. Roll film, for the uninitiated, is a layer of film and a layer of paper wrapped around a cylinder of wood or metal. The layer of paper is still in the camera and advises the user to use Kodak Velox paper "for quality." According to a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/787758589/vintage-camera-seneca-scout-2a-box"> not necessarily reliable source</a>, model 2A was manufactured between 1913 and 1920. The 2A, to my surprise, had an <a href="https://www.pacificrimcamera.com/rl/02396/02396.pdf">achromatic lens</a>. I do not know when the model 2 was manufactured.</figcaption>

<p>The 15th annual Panda’s Thumb Photography Contest begins now, Monday, June 19, at 12:00 p.m., MDT (MDT = UTC(GMT) – 6 h). Entries will be accepted between now and Friday, July 7, at 12:00 p.m., MDT. The rules are precisely the same as previous years’, except, obviously, that the dates have been updated.</p>

<p>We encourage entries in a single, general category, which includes pictures of just about anything of scientific interest: any object of experimentation or observation, from single-celled organisms, through nematodes, fruit flies, rats, chimpanzees, and college sophomores to volcanoes, stars, and galaxies. In order not to omit theoreticians, we will consider computer-generated pictures and also photographs of equipment. Photomicrographs and electron micrographs are likewise welcomed.</p>

<p>Since rumor has it that the pandemic encouraged macro photography, we may, if we receive enough entries, establish a “macro” category.</p>

<p>The winner and the runner-up will receive a copy of Neil Shubin, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540510/some-assembly-required-by-neil-shubin/">Some Assembly Required</a>, a copy of Dan Levitt, 
<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/whats-gotten-into-you-dan-levitt?variant=40390219202594/"> What’s Gotten Into You?</a>, generously donated by the &lt;a href=https://ncse.com/&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, or a copy of one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Matt-Young/author/B001HPILDU/">my own books</a>.</p>

<p>I more or less accidentally came across a copy of Lee McIntyre's 2021 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Science-Denier-Conversations-ebook/dp/B08PCL6NVZ/">How to Talk to a Science Denier</a>, subtitled <i>Conversations with Flat Earthers, Climate Deniers, and Others Who Defy Reason</i>. Having recently <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html">reviewed</a> an earlier book of McIntyre's, <i>The Scientific Attitude</i>, I naturally snapped up <i> How to Talk</i>. I was not entirely disappointed in the book, but <i>The Scientific Attitude</i>, shall we say, was more impressive. <i>How to Talk</i> was like another New York Times Magazine article stretched into a book and must be 30&nbsp;% notes. </p>

<p>And speaking of notes, whereas most of the notes were references, occasionally a note presented important material, but who can reference all those notes, even on an E-reader? If the material was important enough to be included in the book, it should have been in the main text, not in a note.</p>

<p>Oh well, on to the book:</p>

<p><i>This is a synopsis of a <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2023/06/leading-creationist-organisation-appoints-conspiracy-theorist-to-key-position.html">fuller version</a> that has appeared in </i>3 Quarks Daily.</p>
<p>Panda's Thumb readers will be familiar with Answers in Genesis, its position as the most vocal and best funded of Young Earth Creationist organisations (assets in excess of $82 million; owner of the Kentucky Creation Museum and Ark Encounter), its links with the Cornwall Alliance <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/the-nature-of-the-beast-fossil-fuel-corporations-the-cornwall-alliance-and-climate-change-denial/">and hence with the fossil fuel industry</a>, and its use of biblical arguments to dismiss concerns about the current environmental crisis. In my own reading of AiG materials, I have detected a progressive repetitiveness and loss of vigour. I have also noticed worrying signs of openness to the suggestion that we are living in the Last Days, with all that that implies for the abdication of long-term responsibilities. </p>
<p>These worries are intensified by AiG’s <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/core-ministry/special-ministry-announcement-ken-ham/">appointment last month</a> of the lawyer Martyn Iles, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/holy-war-breaks-out-at-the-christian-lobby-20230228-p5co3h.html">until recently</a> Managing Director of the Australian Christian Lobby, to the newly created post of Chief Ministry Officer. Ministry is after all AiG’s entire reason for existence, and Iles, a skilful orator, also has a track record of effectiveness in political interventions, and in fundraising. Ken Ham is now 71, and we can expect Iles, 34, to become increasingly important in shaping AiG’s direction. </p>

  </figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 7, 2023, Ken Ham tweeted that he was soon going to appear on Allie Beth Stuckey’s podcast “Relatable.” Ms. Stuckey has appeared  at at least one Answers in Genesis‘s “Answers for Women” conference and will be at one scheduled in 2024. Her description at AiG can be found <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bios/allie-beth-stuckey/">here</a>. I was previously unfamiliar with Ms. Stuckey, or her popular podcast, so I decided to look closer and await Ken’s future appearance. I glanced at the titles of the more than 800 YouTube videos of the podcast that were available and watched short bits of several. Whew! What a vapid and reactionary show “Relatable” turned out to be! Almost every Christian Nationalist obsession and talking point of the last few years is covered by the podcast; everything from opposition to vaccination mandates to bizarre claims about Antifa being a major part of the January 6 insurrection, to an obsession with gay and transgender people. She could easily be a Tucker Carlson replacement on Fox News.</p>

<p>One of her podcast videos in particular got my attention: Relatable, episode #670, from August 31, 2022, titled “I Don’t Know if Dinosaurs Were Real.” (See <a href="https://youtu.be/kIxU5zG-dwg">here</a>). A major portion of this episode is a discussion of the host’s favorite conspiracy “theories” and an insipid discussion of the existence of aliens with her show’s producer and technical staff.</p>

<p>While discussing whether or not the moon landings were real at 29 minutes 42 seconds into the episode Ms. Stuckey exclaims “I don’t know. Why haven’t we been back?” Then the conversation drifts into her conspiratorial views on dinosaurs. She blathers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s my conspiracy theory and I’ll just drop this and let y’all discuss what you think this is a theory, okay, I’m just gonna say this - Dinosaurs never existed. Thoughts? Discuss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every so often, the Evolution News site run by the Discovery Institute 
brings in an expert to explain why the adaptations in organisms 
cannot be explained by natural evolutionary processes.  I was about 
to discuss the argument of one of these experts, when another,
even-more-impressive expert showed up.  For this post, I’ll 
discuss the arguments of the first one, the medical oncologist Dr. Stephen Iacoboni.
In the next part, I will consider those of
the particle physicist Dr. Eric Hedin, who 
is also Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry, Physics 
and Engineering at Biola University.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I do not doubt that Dr. Iacoboni is an “award-winning cancer 
researcher”.  But somehow these impressive 
credentials do not carry over into a discussion of natural 
selection.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dr. Iacoboni has written two articles at Evolution News, 
the first <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/04/a-new-look-at-natural-selection/"><em>A New Look at Natural Selection</em></a> on 
April 18, and
the second <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2023/05/natural-selection-subtracts-it-doesnt-add-and-that-matters/"><em>Natural selection subtracts, it doesn’t add – and that matters</em></a> on May 16.  The latter 
is decorated with the dramatic image of a constipated Polar Bear.</p>

<p>Iacoboni argues that all of the natural world, including 
all aspects of each organism’s environment, are designed, and 
it is this design that causes organisms to have adaptations.
So has the ability of natural selection to increase the adaptive 
information in the genomes of living organisms been decisively 
refuted by his argument?  Let’s see … (but no prize for guessing that my 
answer is going to be “no”).</p>
