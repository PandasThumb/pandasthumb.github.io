<p>A slightly late Merry Kitzmas to all! The 2005 <i><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Kitzmiller+v.+Dover%2C+panda%27s+thumb">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board</a></i> case, where <a href="https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html">“Intelligent Design” went on trial</a> (Matzke 2006) is now 18 years old. Amazingly, 18 years is the same number of years as between the 1987 <i><a href="https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html">Edwards v. Aguillard</a></i> Supreme Court decision and <i>Kitzmiller</i>. I would say that the prominence of antievolutionism has receded in the latter 18 years, compared to numerous other culture wars, real wars, and challenges to the fundamentals of science-informed liberal democracy that have dominated the news in recent years.</p>

<p>In that sense, <i>Kitzmiller</i> has definitely had a positive impact. However, we should keep in mind that Alabama <i><b>still</b></i> has a warning label in its textbooks (see this story by <a href="https://www.al.com/educationlab/2023/11/alabama-to-update-science-standards-keep-evolution-disclaimer.html">Trisha Crain, 2023, al.com</a>), several “critical analysis” antievolution policies remain on the books (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aad4057">Matzke 2015</a>), for example the Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008 (<a href="https://ncse.ngo/how-mike-johnson-helped-open-door-creationism-louisiana-public-schools">NCSE 2023</a>), and keeps evolving (<a href="http://phylo.wikidot.com/matzke-2015-science-paper-on-the-evolution-of-antievolution">Matzke 2015</a>), <a href="https://ncse.ngo/how-mike-johnson-helped-open-door-creationism-louisiana-public-schools">Creation-museum-boosting young-earth creationist Mike Johnson</a> is Speaker of the US House and third in line to the Presidency, the <a href="https://ncse.ngo/aftermath-texass-disappointing-vote-science-textbooks">Texas Board of Education is still blocking textbooks with coverage of evolution and climate change that they don’t like</a>, etc.  As Rob Pennock always says, “stay vigilant!”</p>

<p>Longtime PT readers may recall some interesting scientific publications that came out of the <i>Kitzmiller</i> case, mostly reviewing the relevant science. Examples include the evolutionary origin of the immune system (Bottaro, Inlay, and Matzke 2006, <i>Nature Immunology</i>; see also posts at <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/04/pt-posters-in-n.html">PT</a> and <a href="https://ncse.ngo/annotated-bibliography-evolutionary-origin-vertebrate-immune-system">NCSE</a>), the evolutionary origin of complex adaptations (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0701505104">Scott and Matzke 2007</a>, <i>PNAS</i>; <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/05/nas-sackler-col.html">PT post</a>), or tracking the “evolution” of antievolution bills (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4057">Matzke 2016</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4057"><i>Science</i></a>; <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/12/bonus-material.html">PT post</a>; <a href="http://phylo.wikidot.com/matzke-2015-science-paper-on-the-evolution-of-antievolution">free online Supplemental Data</a>). Another was on the evolution of the bacterial flagellum (<a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro1493">Pallen &amp; Matzke, 2006, <i>Nature Reviews Microbiology</i></a>; <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/flagellum-evolu.html">PT post</a>), which I think crossed over into novel research on the origin of a complex adaptation, even though the article was mostly assembling previous findings into a coherent scenario. I have maintained an interest in the evolution of the flagellum, and I would like to present some new research that, in a roundabout way, derives from the flagellum work and from <i>Kitzmiller</i>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Almost literally, as I was finishing the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snowflake-Kenneth-Libbrecht-ebook/dp/B01G8U33WC ">The Snowflake: Winter’s Frozen Artistry</a>, by Kenneth Libbrecht and Rachel Wing, I heard <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/25/1217356234/just-how-big-can-a-snowflake-get-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-snowflake">this report</a> on NPR: Professor Libbrecht had discovered and photographed what, as far as anyone knows, is the largest single-crystal snowflake ever discovered – approximately 10 mm across. The snowflake was evidently larger than the field of view of Prof Libbrecht’s microscope and had to be photographed in 4 quadrants, which were later digitally stitched together. The snowflake has been accepted in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>

<p>As for the book by Libbrecht and Wing, it is short, wastes hardly a word, and was a pleasure to read. It is not a technical book, nor is it a children’s book, yet I kept thinking that much of the early chapters would be an excellent way to stimulate an interest in science in, say, medium-sized children. As of this writing, you may get the Kindle edition of the book for approximately $3, US. I read it on a Kindle Paperwhite, which gives a small, black-and-white image, so I had to look at some of the images on a computer monitor in order to get full color and resolution. The formatting on the Kindle was not wonderful, but it was manageable. More below the fold.</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-bellied_Whistling-Duck/overview"><i>Dendrocygna autumnalis</i> </a> – black-bellied whistling duck, Boulder, Colorado, December, 2023. According to the range map in the link, these ducks are found almost entirely south of the US. In Central America, they are found primarily along the coasts. The link says that they are expanding northward into several southern states. Colorado seems a long way off (not to mention that it is cold and not exactly coastal). The lighting was poor (and flat), but I managed to get some pictures at ISO 1250, a number which would have been almost unheard of not so very long ago. The bird sat placidly posing for photographs, but was gone the next day. Thanks to Paul Strode for the identification.

<p><i>A week or so ago, in an article <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/12/creationism-again.html">here</a>, we linked to an article in HuffPost, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739">How Mike Johnson Helped Open the Door to Creationism in Louisiana Public Schools</a>, by Paul Blumenthal. That article detailed not only how the Speaker of the House of Representatives represented the Ark Park in Kentucky, but also how he spurred the passage of laws allowing creationism into public school classrooms in Louisiana. Much of the content of that article depended on several people – Barbara Forrest, Glenn Branch, and Zach Kopplin – closely related to the National Center for Science Education, as detailed recently in the NCSE Monitor, an online magazine that I get every week in my e-mail. I feel a little bit like bragging vicariously, so here is the article from the Monitor, reprinted with permission. The original title of the article was the same as that of the HuffPost article. </i></p>

<p>The support provided to creationism by Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the new Speaker of the House, was the topic of a detailed <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-creationism-schools_n_657380ffe4b09724b4342739">report</a> in HuffPost (December 9, 2023) — and people associated with NCSE were a major source of information.</p>

<p>Referring to the so-called Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008, the report summarized, “When the law faced challenges to its implementation and schools faced lawsuits for teaching creationism, Johnson, who worked as a senior litigator for the Alliance Defending Freedom and sat on the Louisiana Family Forum’s attorneys resources council, was the one to swoop in with legal memos, letters threatening lawsuits, and prayer rallies on behalf of the religious-right groups opposed to secular education.”</p>
