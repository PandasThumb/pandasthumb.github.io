<p><i>Joel Eissenberg is Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. He is the author of the recent article, <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/04/how-humans-lost-tails.html">How humans lost their tails</a></i>.</p>

<p>As a college junior, I took a course in microbial genetics. The text was Gunter Stent’s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Genetics-Introductory-Gunther-Stent/dp/0716710285">Molecular Genetics</a></i>. I map the beginning of my career as a geneticist to that course. Stent’s book is a history of the origins of molecular biology, and in retrospect, I believe it was the combination of the history and the science that beguiled me. This potent combination is on offer in Siddhartha Mukherjee’s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Song-Cell-Exploration-Medicine-Human/dp/1982117354/">The Song of the Cell</a>: An Exploration of Medicine and the New Human</i>. I generally avoid popular science books in my field, but this book was a gift from my daughter. I had read and enjoyed Mukherjee’s <i>The Emperor of all Maladies</i>, so I was hoping for something special. I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>The factual information about cells and their roles in tissues and organs, and in disease were well established by the time most of us learned it in school, we mostly learned it by rote. Mukherjee uses the history of scientific discoveries about cells to show us not only each discovery, but also the context in which it was made and the impact it had on thinking at the time. Indeed, the book is chock-a-block with historical anecdotes. Many of these discoveries were controversial at the time, like germ theory as the basis for putrefaction and for disease. The esteemed evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr mocked Carl Woese’s proposal of Archea as a third kingdom of life; Mayr was wrong and Woese was vindicated. Even today, the origins of eukaryotic cells are still controversial.</p>

<p>Mukherjee is a marvelous storyteller. For example, he tells the story that when lipids were extracted from a carefully measured number of red blood cells and spread out on a surface, the area was twice that necessary to contain that number of cells, pointing to a lipid bilayer, rather than monolayer. He is very effective at explaining how discoveries emerge at the confluence of scientific disciplines; e.g., the marriage of microscopy and biochemistry to define the functions of various organelles.</p>

<p><i>Joel Eissenberg is a professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. His research interests include transcriptional control of gene expression and vesicle trafficking. He has had a lifelong fascination with genomics and with developmental biology.</i></p>

<p>In a recent <i>Nature</i> paper, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10901737/pdf/41586_2024_Article_7095.pdf"> Xia et al.</a> offer a mechanistic explanation for tail-loss evolution in humans and anthropomorphous apes. It turns out that loss of a tail is caused by loss of a gene function among the tailless primates. And as the paper shows, this evolutionary transition was mediated by transposable elements, that is, repeated parasitic DNA fragments that are found in all living things.</p>

<figcaption>Morning dew on an unidentified leaf, Ganges, Saltspring Island, B.C. Canon 40D, 100&nbsp;mm macro. Mr. Phelps writes: "Vancouver Island is temperate rainforest. Our property is mostly a sharp, rocky ridge with a couple micro-climates. Standard issue fir trees, ferns, etc. on the north side, and a bit more of a Southern Oregon feel on the top of the ridge, with some pines and lots of Arbutus. Very hot in summer with all the rock." He adds that since taking the photo some years ago, he has learned that the droplets might be due to transpiration rather than dew. He further adds parenthetically that Capt Stormfield is a "name adopted from Mark Twain's short story '<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1044/1044-h/1044-h.htm">Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven</a>.' Reading this at the age of 14 &ndash; despite the disapproval of the teacher at the [Seventh Day Adventist] church school I was attending &ndash; is my first recollection of the awakening skepticism that led me out of fundamentalism by my undergrad years."

<p>Bishop Wilberforce, in 1860, was a <i>skeptic</i>, praised by Darwin for the skill of his questioning. Today’s creationists, not least the Discovery Institute, are <i>denialists</i>, endlessly asking the same questions as he did, although they have long since been answered.</p>

<p>Yes, Bishop Wilberforce really did ask T.H. Huxley, “Darwin’s bulldog,” whether he would prefer an ape for his grandfather, and a woman for his grandmother, or a man for his grandfather, and an ape for his grandmother. And Huxley really did say that he would prefer this to descent from a man conspicuous for his talents and eloquence, but who misused his gifts to ridicule science and obscure the light of truth. This and more at the very first public debate regarding Darwin’s work on evolution, only months after the publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i>.</p>

<p>I first wrote the above paragraph in <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2017/10/huxley-wilberforce-darwin-apes-and-grandparents-a-victorian-scandal-revisited.html">3 Quarks Daily</a>  in 2017, shortly after <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsnr.2016.0058">Richard England had published</a> on the way that the events had been described in the <i>Oxford Chronicle</i>, the fullest contemporary account available of the encounter. That account refuted doubts that had been raised <sup>1</sup> by some historians, and which I had seen referred to by creationists, wishing to minimise the episode or even to regard it as legendary. These doubts were based largely on the absence of the episode from the account in the gentlemanly <i>Athenaeum</i>, but England convincingly showed that the <i>Athenaeum</i> had practised censorship.</p>

<p>I am writing about this again today in response to an <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2024/02/what-really-happened-at-the-huxley-wilberforce-debate/">article</a> in the mendaciously mistitled <i>Evolution News</i>, mouthpiece of the neocreationist Discovery Institute, by Robert Shedinger, Professor of Religion at Luther College, Iowa. Shedinger has discovered a second career dissing Darwin. He is best known to readers here for his recent book, <i>Darwin’s Bluff</i>, where he argues that Darwin’s voluminous unpublished notes demonstrate his inability to support his views, and the article I am discussing is an extract from that book. We must therefore regard it, not as a mere passing comment, but as the author’s considered opinion.</p>
