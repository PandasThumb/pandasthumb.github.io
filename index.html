<p>The year 2025 is the 20th anniversary of the <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> case. Celebrations were held <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/12/KvDv19.html">throughout the year</a> as part of the 100th anniversary of <i>Scopes</i>. I got to attend the July 2025 Nashville Scopes Trial event on the campus of Vanderbilt University, where I got to reconnect with many Doverians and other veterans of the evolution wars. Many of those talks are now online on YouTube.  Just after that, I also got to see my 100-year old grandmother one last time. She passed away soon after at the age of 101. Her life spanned the entire American creation/evolution debate from 1924-2025. Ironically, grandma sending me creationism books when I was a kid in the 1980s is part of what got me into the creation/evolution debate in the first place.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time I’ve found my family history and the creationism debate crashing together: back in 2009, I gave a talk to the University of Oklahoma Zoology Department as part of their series for the 150th anniversary of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, then found myself sharing a bed-and-breakfast with Richard Dawkins who was giving a talk to the whole University. In the space of 24 hours I found myself dining with my creationist grandma and someone who was basically her arch-nemesis.</p>

<p>We invite readers to give their own reflections on Dover, the science/creationism debate and subsequent developments, or personal updates in the comments below. Also, if they like, Kitzmiller participants can send me comments for me to add as edits to the main post (this may take a bit, as I’m now on holiday with the Aussie side of the family; the kids tell me there is a koala down the road).</p>

<p>I will post several updates from this year which I hope you will enjoy. I should have blogged these at the time, but, well, 3 kids and a day job!</p>

    <p>Update on antievolution legislation. I had intended to update the Matzke (2015) analysis of the “evolution of antievolution legislation.”  I have progressed this through the data coding stage, but now it’s the holidays so it will take a bit longer to do the phylogenetics. However, it’s interesting to paste all the bills since 2015 together to see the wacky stuff that is still proposed, and sometimes passed (like in West Virginia in 2024; see my comments in Science on that, published just before I wrote a letter to <i>Science</i> on a similar scale of weirdness in science education coming from the other political side, in New Zealand).</p>

<p>Lately, the Discovery Institute’s ID site Science and Culture has had almost 
no arguments that would convince any scientist that Intelligent Design 
contributed to the diversity of life.  Michael Behe’s arguments are the 
same as before, and William Dembski’s latest versions of his specified 
complexity argument leaves out any discussion of why having a large 
value (of his Algorithmic Specified Complexity) cannot be achieved by 
ordinary evolutionary processes.</p>

<p>But at S&amp;C they <em>are</em> getting a bit angry at evolutionary biologists. For 
stealing credit that belongs to ID advocates.  A post on December 12, 
is titled “All the Evidence Points to Design, but the Credit Goes to … You Know What”. 
Even more remarkably, its author is “Science and Culture”.  This makes it 
an official statement by the site.  Or else none of their people want to 
take credit or blame for it.</p>

<p>They simply point to an article at BioEssays on “spatiotemporal cues in 
cell division”, in particular to its last paragraph, which contains the 
sentence (boldface text is S&amp;C’s emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why evolution selected chromosomes</strong> as a platform to integrate different signals 
is easily explained by the need to concentrate mitotic regulators (and their control) 
which would otherwise dilute in a vast cytoplasmic ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and S&amp;C’s comment is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many years ago, William Dembski said that one of the most objectionable aspects of modern evolutionary theory was the undeserved, unearned credit it steals from the exquisite, transcendentally elegant work of the Designer. Put more bluntly, evolution is a credit thief, a lowdown sleazy embezzler. If we could personify evolution, we’d have ChatGPT make a drawing of the word as a convict with a prison serial number across its chest.
But if you just put your thumb over the word “evolution” in the phrase we highlighted, all the evidence for design is still there, and it’s just too cool for words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, all the wonderful details of biological systems must be evidence for Intelligent Design, 
it’s so obvious that they figure anyone can see this.  If a biologist lapses into 
teleological language that personifies evolution, this must mean they acknowledge 
that Design Intervention happened, but are too scared to admit it, and give credit to 
a personified Evolution instead.</p>

<p>Well, the matter can be looked at another way …</p>

        <p>Judge John Jones III of Dover, Pennsylvania, fame is now president of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. A certain little bird told us today of an interview with President Jones reported by Seth Kaplan of television station WHTM in Harrisburg: <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/the-deadly-fact-that-doomed-intelligent-design-in-dover-schools-20-years-ago-this-month/">The ‘deadly’ fact that doomed ‘intelligent design’ in Dover schools 20 years ago this month</a>. The interview was interesting, in part because President Jones, as the little bird put it, discusses the case itself, not legal matters. In particular, President Jones pointed out many problems with the defense’s case, including,</p>

<blockquote><ul><li>Side-by-side comparisons between the version of “Of Pandas and People” on the school library shelf and a previous version: “The prior edition had the words ‘creation science,’ and they simply changed those words in the in the (sic) later edition of the book to to ‘intelligent design’ — pretty deadly if you’re trying to say that that intelligent design is not the successor to creation science,” Jones said.</li>
<li>“When asked who the designer was, they [defense witnesses] were compelled in honesty to say that they felt the designer was God,” Jones said. “Fair enough, but that makes it difficult to uphold as a scientific concept.”</li></ul> </blockquote>

<p>Mr. Kaplan’s article, linked above, is worth reading in its entirety.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On November 29, Answers In Genesis apologist and astronomer Danny Faulkner posted an article on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Dr. Faulkner’s article sensibly dismissed popular speculation (including persistent claims by Harvard professor Avi Loeb) that 3I/ATLAS and similar objects might be artificial probes or alien artifacts. But in doing so, Faulkner never addressed the only question that is cosmologically relevant for a young-earth framework: Where did this object come from? Interstellar comets are not curiosities or distractions; they are kinematic probes: natural test cases for any model purporting that the universe is only a few thousand years old.</p>

<p>For an organization that claims to be able to give “Answers” about what they call “origin science”, Answers In Genesis is suspiciously quiet about the origins of interstellar comets.</p>

<h3 id="the-third-interstellar-comet">The Third Interstellar Comet</h3>

<p>Ever since the rise of wide-field astronomical surveys, astronomers have kept a vigilant watch on the skies for near-Earth objects (NEOs): asteroids and comets whose orbits may bring them close to the Earth, with potential risk of impact. But beyond planetary defense, surveys also catalog a broad variety of small bodies because these minor objects carry clues about the formation and evolution of planetary systems: their orbits, compositions, and dynamics help scientists trace back when and how they formed, and how stable their source systems remain.</p>

<p>Comets in our solar system come in different flavors. Short-period comets have orbits closely bound to the Sun, often returning every few years or decades, typically originating in the Kuiper Belt or closer. Long-period comets have highly elongated but still bound orbits, often taking thousands or millions of years to complete (usually thought to arise in the distant Oort Cloud). Both of these types remain gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit with very different orbital periods. A third, much rarer category — hyperbolic or interstellar comets — follows an unbound trajectory. Their eccentricity exceeds 1, placing them on a one-time pass through the Solar System: they arrive from interstellar space, swing past the Sun, and then depart forever.</p>

<p>In 2025, the world encountered only the third such confirmed interstellar visitor. The first was 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in October 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov, announced in August 2019. The newest, 3I/ATLAS, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered this July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. Follow-up observations soon confirmed its extremely hyperbolic orbit. Because 3I/ATLAS is active (i.e., showing a fuzzy coma and dust tail, like a “normal” comet) astronomers treat it as a genuine cometary body, not a rocky asteroid.</p>

<h3 id="faulkners-cosmological-commitments">Faulkner’s Cosmological Commitments</h3>

<p>Dr. Danny Faulkner has become the predominant AIG author and speaker on issues of astronomy since the departure of Dr. Jason Lisle some years ago, writing on topics ranging from light-travel-time and starlight problems to extrasolar planets, dark matter and dark energy, planetary system formation, and the operation of modern astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope. Over the years, he has articulated a reasonably consistent set of commitments in his elucidation of a “Biblical” cosmology. In defense of a recent special creation, he has argued that divine creation is characterized by stability and order, even using this perceived order as evidence for divine design.</p>
