        <p>I consider a miracle to be something that I understand in some detail and know it is impossible, yet there it is in my hand for $200 – a digital camera, for example. I do not understand the James Webb Space Telescope in nearly as much detail, but I still consider it a miracle. <i>Science</i> may not agree with my definition of a miracle, but they consider the telescope the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2022">Breakthrough of the Year</a>. Hard to argue with: the telescope itself is absolutely remarkable, as are some of the images it has returned.</p>

<p><i>Science</i>’s runners-up include perennial rice, the new-found creativity of artificial intelligence, deflection of an asteroid, two advances in virology – a nascent RSV vaccine and the discovery that multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus – and several others. What they call “Breakdowns” are fewer: the fact that zero Covid no longer works (if it ever did), the fact that science ties between nations are “fraying,” and the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions owing to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Answers in Genesis posted a <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/science/year-review-top-science-news-2022/">Year in Review</a>, by Troy Lacey, which they arranged chronologically by month, rather than in order of importance. A few comments below the fold.</p>

<figcaption>Ice crystals on a window during the recent cold snap, December 23, 2022, at around 7:40 a.m. The window is nearly 2&nbsp;m tall and double-paned. It sits behind an insulated Roman shade known as a Warm Window, so it gets very cold near the bottom. The hills are a few millimeters across and melt very quickly once the shade is pulled up.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we are at the last day of 2022, the newspapers are full of accounts of what happened in 2022.  Even the Discovery Institute has bragged, at its site <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/12/the-year-in-review-intelligent-design-grows-in-influence-and-depth/">Evolution News &amp; Science Today</a>
how much the cause of Intelligent Design advanced in the last year.  This account, by Brian Miller, was mocked by critics of ID (e.g. <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/30/the-enduring-futility-of-intelligent-design-creationism/">here</a>, <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/id-achievements-of-the-year/15635">here</a>, and <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/01/01/follow-up-on-id-at-conferences/">here</a>).</p>

<p>It is hard to come up with lists of things that happened in 2022.  But much easier to make lists of things that didn’t happen.  I wondered: what are the major things 
that <em>didn’t</em> happen in 2022?  Particularly with regard to arguments for Intelligent Design.</p>

<p>I’ll provide my suggested non-event.   It is the clarification of how the Algorithmic Complexity argument for Intelligent Design works.  It remains, as it has been 
for some years, basically unexplained.  A reading of the whole course of argument using Specified Complexity, from William Dembski’s book <em>The Design Inference</em> on, 
shows that the algorithmic complexity calculation started out as a peripheral suggestion and gradually changed until it is now said to be central to that 
argument.  But in the course of these changes, the logic of the criterion became no clearer.</p>

<p>Some time ago I puzzled over this <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html">perhaps at too great a length</a> in a post here at Panda’s Thumb.  Was the algorithm supposed to compute the genotype?  the phenotype? 
Why was observation that it was nonrandomly un-complex supposed to favor ID?  How did the probability distribution of algorithms that was used make biological sense?</p>

<p>Another year has passed, and none of these questions have been answered.  So I nominate this non-event as the greatest non-achievement of Intelligent Design proponents 
in 2022.  I congratulate them.  But our readers may have other non-achievements to suggest.  Let’s hear from them.</p>

<p>Jerry Coyne on his blog today advises us to <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/29/take-the-faraday-institutes-science-vs-religion-quiz/">Take the Faraday Institute’s Science vs. Religion quiz!</a> So I did! <a href="https://www.sciencereligioncompass.org/">(Here.)</a></p>

<p>You may see my result to the left. I ended up in the fourth quadrant, relatively close to the y-axis. The axis labels are to some extent jargon: Functional means that religion is best at social activities, what Dr. Coyne and I would call “tikkun olam,” or “repairing the world.” Substantive, by contrast, means that religion has meaning or content. The terms on the x-axis are reasonably clear, but I consider scientism to be pejorative and wish they had found a better term. (I have more than once been accused of scientism and am somewhat gratified that I did not land farther to the right.)</p>

<p>Here is what the quiz makers said about me, and it is fairly accurate:</p>

        <p>The New York Times on Sunday ran what I consider a very credulous article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/24/opinion/miracles-neuroscience-proof.html">How Would You Prove That God Performed a Miracle?</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/molly-worthen">Molly Worthen</a>, an historian who, I thought, had not the foggiest idea how you would do so. You may read Jerry Coyne’s takedown of her article <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/26/nyt-touts-religious-miracles-as-proof-of-god/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Worthen lets William Dembski get the last word. We have criticized Dr. Dembski seemingly endlessly on this blog, but here I think he’s got it essentially right:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I believe in miracles, but I think they require scrutiny,” Dr. Dembski told me [Dr. Worthen]. “I don’t tend to see things as flamboyant as in the New Testament.” He published a moving <a href="https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/first-person-faith-healing-wheres-the-evidence/">account</a> of his family’s disappointment at a healing revival, where he sought prayer for his autistic son. “There can be quite a bit of self-delusion on the part of people looking for miracles, and it troubles me,” he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Dembski’s family has learned to look for the miraculous in everyday loving encounters, like when a teacher’s aide made it her mission to help his son learn to use the bathroom on his own. “His life is so much better because of this person who wouldn’t give up on him,” he said. “It was no miracle, in terms of a magic wand that touched him and everything was fine. It was people who were willing to love him and do the hard work.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Dembski says he believes in miracles. Or perhaps gives lip service to a belief in miracles. What happened when it got down to brass tacks, as when he took his autistic child to the so-called faith healer? The supposed healer refused to see the child because he did not “look the part”; Dr. Dembski saw right through faith healing and indeed recognized it as “self-delusion.”</p>

<p>I consider a miracle to be a figure of speech for when, say, that teacher takes his son under her wing, does the very best she can with him, and, against the odds, succeeds. Dr. Dembski professes a belief in literal miracles, but seems more impressed with practical, figure-of-speech–type miracles. On that, we can agree.</p>
