<p>Sabine Hossenfelder is fearless. Though she would allow you to believe anything you want to, as long as your belief is at least consistent with what we know about science, she will remind you whenever there is no evidence in favor of your belief. Indeed, she says,</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your belief conflicts with empirically confirmed knowledge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then you are not seeking meaning; you are delusional.</blockquote>

<p>If you want to hold onto your delusions, she avers, then this book is not for you. She treats beliefs that do not conflict with what we know as harmless and indeed thinks that “scientists should acknowledge that science is compatible with many traditional sacred beliefs.” Thus, she (indirectly) criticizes Richard Dawkins and the “new atheists” for being too rigid in their beliefs: we have no evidence to distinguish between a Big Bang that was created by God and one that was not. She is right.</p>

<p>An informant tells us that Answers in Genesis is looking for a high school “science” teacher for their “Answers Academy” (formerly “Twelve Stones Academy”) [informant’s quotation marks]. Here are some of the <a href="https://www.paycomonline.net/v4/ats/web.php/jobs/ViewJobDetails?clientkey=36BAEBCF961EB253FD190A922A7D98D6&amp;job=77715">requirements</a> for the job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The qualified individual must be an evangelical Christian committed to living a biblical lifestyle in all areas and in full agreement with the schools (sic) statement of faith. The teacher is expected to be in alignment with the science and biblical positions held at Answers in Genesis and able to teach science from a biblical worldview in the classroom. The teacher must also be able to distinguish operational vs historical science as well as be able to articulate the evolutionary beliefs correctly while being able to refute them biblically and scientifically. The teacher must also have a good understanding of AiGs (sic) presuppositional apologetic approach and know how to incorporate it in the classroom.</p>

<p>The teacher shall be one who feels called of God to the teaching profession. The teacher must maintain a teachable spirit while demonstrating patience, humility, integrity, and kindness while performing his/her day-to-day duties. He/she must be devoted to prayerfully work with administration, faculty, students, and parents to develop and maintain a school which is thoroughly Christian and academically exceptional. The teacher shall prayerfully help students learn attitudes, skills, and subject matter that will contribute to their development as mature, able, and responsible Christians to the glory of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest is mostly boilerplate, except for the requirements to adhere to AIG’s statement of faith, be “deeply committed to a consistent daily walk with Jesus Christ,” spend time in prayer, attend church services, be a Christian role model, and so on. There is no indication what subjects are to be taught nor at what grade level, except for the requirement that the material must be tied to the Bible. If anyone is interested, you may click the “Apply” button and submit your résumé.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/04/25/cobb-and-comfort-on-the-contributions-of-rosalind-franklin-to-solving-the-structure-of-dna/">Jerry Coyne reminds us</a>, is the 70th anniversary of the publication of the structure of DNA in three <i>Nature</i> papers by Watson and Crick; Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson; and Franklin and Gosling. Coyne takes the opportunity to remind us that much of the “folklore” concerning Rosalind Franklin is false and based on a nearly fictional characterization written by James Watson, who frankly makes himself look like a fool. At any rate, it was Watson himself who initiated the conceit that a critical X-ray interferogram taken by Franklin had actually been stolen.</p>

<p>Coyne cites new work by Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort showing that in fact neither Watson nor Crick himself saw the critical interferogram. Cobb is a biologist at Manchester and is writing a biography of Watson; Comfort is a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University and is writing a biography of Crick. The two collaborated and discovered that Watson and Crick had actually read a report, and that Franklin knew that Max Perutz had passed the report to them. Indeed, Franklin remained friends with Crick throughout the rest of her life.</p>

<p>None of this will be exactly shocking to anyone who has read <i>The Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix</i>, by the scientist and historian Howard Markel. I reviewed the book on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQ9BL2R1HJN1?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp">here</a> (it is a bad habit I occasionally indulge in). Franklin was a remarkable scientist who, as the Wikimedia caption notes, contributed to understanding the structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.</p>

<p>I came away from Markel’s book with the impression that Watson had seen the X-ray interferogram, and Franklin was unaware that he had. The work of Cobb and Comfort suggests that in fact Watson had not seen the X-ray let alone stolen it. That said, the end of Markel’s book is a long, long interview with Watson, and I thought that Watson, for whatever reason, came across as knowing that he had not been entirely honest.</p>

<p>This post by Paul Callahan is copied from a series of comments that were posted <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/04/uncommondead.html">here</a> and which we thought were fascinating but off-task. The comments document a discussion between Mr. Callahan and <strong>ChatGPT</strong> (version 3.5) regarding young-earth creationism and intelligent-design creationism. We deemed them interesting and reproduce them here with Mr. Callahan’s permission. (He says: Note that this was ChatGPT 3.5, not 4, which is the latest public version. I haven’t tried it on that. I don’t think there will be much of a difference in substance.) Matt Young copied and pasted from the comments section and claims responsibility for any errors of transcription.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Callahan</strong> is a former academic computer scientist with about 25 years experience as a software engineer. He has a strong interest in evolution and emergent complexity, particularly cellular automata, and has contributed some new results about Conway’s Game of Life.</p>

<p>Mr. Callahan writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>My intent here is not to play gotcha with ChatGPT 3.5. Large language models like this are a genuine breakthrough with many useful applications when used appropriately. I was curious how it would deal with the subject of creationism. I am mostly satisfied with its explanation of the scientific consensus on evolution. However, it was far too circumspect when it came to identifying creationism as a refuted belief.</p>

<p>I played around to see how it would handle another false statement, which it had no problem identifying as false. I understand the distinction it's actually making. When I identify "black is white" as false, I am very unlikely to generate any controversy. By contrast, I will generate controversy when I identify as false "the earth and its species were created in seven days as stated in Genesis." Yet both are refuted by empirical evidence. Conversely, both can be "rescued" by appealing to unfalsifiable beliefs. The only real distinction seems to be a constituency who will be offended. It's understandable that ChatGPT will try to be sensitive to people and their religious beliefs. So am I, usually. I only wish it was more forthcoming about the precise distinction.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Herewith, the discussion between Mr. Callahan and ChatGPT. Mr. Callahan’s questions are flush left, and those of ChatGPT are indented.</p>

<p>Somewhat on topic (yeah, it’s a stretch), I asked ChatGPT for its recollection of <strong>Uncommon Descent</strong>:</p>

<p>Do you know of a blog called Uncommon Descent?</p>

<blockquote>Yes, Uncommon Descent is a blog that focuses on topics related to <strong>intelligent design</strong> and is known for presenting arguments and viewpoints that support intelligent design as an alternative to evolutionary theory. The blog features posts written by various contributors who advocate for intelligent the, including some of the individuals mentioned earlier who are associated with the intelligent design movement. However, it's important to note that Uncommon Descent is not a peer-reviewed scientific publication, and its views are not widely accepted or considered scientifically valid by the mainstream scientific community. As with any source of information, it's important to critically evaluate the content and consider multiple perspectives, including those of the mainstream scientific community, when forming an understanding of complex scientific topics like intelligent design.</blockquote>

<p>I have to dock it some points for referring to ID as a “scientific topic,” but that’s a large language model for you.</p>
