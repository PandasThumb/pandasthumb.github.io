<figcaption><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Down-Tree-Evolutionary-Biology/dp/0197805167/"><i>Looking down the Tree – The Evolutionary Biology of Human Origins</i></a>, by Mitch Cruzan, Oxford University Press, October, 2025.</figcaption>

<p><i>Mitch Cruzan is Professor of Biology at Portland State University. He received his BA and MA in Biology from California State University, Fullerton, and his PhD from Stony Brook University. He is currently an associate editor for Molecular Ecology, a leading journal in the field. He has published more than 80 papers in the primary literature and an advanced textbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Biology-Perspective-Mitchell-Cruzan/dp/0190882670">Evolutionary Biology: A Plant Perspective</a>. His latest book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Down-Tree-Evolutionary-Biology/dp/B0FQYC1Q57">Looking Down the Tree – Exploring the Origins of Our Species</a>, is due to be published in a few days, and we have invited him to offer a preview here.</i></p>

<p>I have offered an introductory course on evolution annually over the last 15 years. I always saved in-depth discussions of human evolution to the end for two reasons. First, to discuss human evolution in a meaningful way, we need to have a good understanding of evolutionary principles and processes. Second, I thought it was a good highlight for the course to end on. Each year, I incorporated new information and new ideas about human origins. Much of this content came from the questions that students asked; they weren’t satisfied to look a series of fossil remains or boring details about human genomics. They wanted to know more about the origins of our unique appearance and behaviors, and particularly secondary sexual characteristics.</p>

<p>Why does anyone take on a particular subject for a non-fiction book? You might ask, what could a plant evolutionary biologist such as myself possibly have to say about human evolution? Some reviewers actually said that I had no business writing this book. But evolutionary biology consists of a set of principles and processes that can be applied to any organism. Yes, it helps to have knowledge of the biology of a species, but for humans, that information is readily available. For me, developing the material was a natural process as I explored aspects of human evolution, along with the students in my introductory evolution lectures. By the time the pandemic hit, I had developed what I thought was a unique story of the origin of human traits – one that made sense in the context of the habitats our ancestors inhabited.</p>

<p>This book is not just a rehash of previous statements and ideas. By integrating information from disparate fields such as paleontology, anthropology, and genomics, I have drawn unique conclusions about the origins of human traits and behaviors.</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Brodgar">Ring of Brodgar</a>, Mainland Island, Orkney Islands, Scotland, May 21, 2023. Mr. Long writes, "This is part of the Orkney Neolithic Complex recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  It is unusual in having a ring of standing stones (27 at present, of 60 originally) associated with a henge.  Age is estimated as 2000-2500 BCE on poor data.  The fact that it is the northernmost henge and stone circle in Great Britain may be understood by reference to a map; little of Great Britain is farther north.  Technical: Olympus OM-D EM-1 Mark III, Olympus 12-40 mm, f/2.8 at 27 mm, 1/60 s, f/16, ISO 200, handheld."

<p><i>Jamie Jensen is a biologist and discipline-based education researcher at Brigham Young University, where she is a Professor of Biology. She has spent her career researching ways to help students and the public reconcile science with religious worldviews and has done work across the U.S., with the Smithsonian, and in other parts of the world including Qatar, South Africa, and Hungary.</i></p>

<p>I recently had the “opportunity” to visit the “Ark Encounter” and “Creation Museum” attractions in Kentucky while visiting Vanderbilt University for the Scopes Centennial Celebration. After participating in the academic meeting, I took a group of undergraduate students with me to these two attractions; these students work in my research lab investigating ways to communicate accurate evolutionary science across religious divides. We have had quite a bit of success in our efforts to increase evolution acceptance in the classroom without damaging students’ religious identities (see <a href="https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-015-0051-6">here</a>, <a href="https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-020-00133-9">here</a>, and <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/abt/article-abstract/84/2/75/119835/Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Science?redirectedFrom=fulltext">here</a>). However, with some of my more public-focused programming, I have met with varying levels of resistance (and sometimes hostility), even from members of my own Christian religious “in-group.” (Yes, I do belong to a conservative Christian religion. And I also fully embrace the modern science of evolution, in its entirety.)</p>

<p>We went to these two attractions seeking to better understand the viewpoints of those who stand in opposition to evolution, and to characterize the misconceptions and logical fallacies that may stand in the way of effective communication across the divide. We were astonished at the extent and sophistication of the attempts made to “create” science that supports alternative worldviews. This is not a case of trying to “sweep under the rug” the inconsistencies between a biblical account of creation and the physical evidence we see around us. It was, rather, an elaborate attempt to build a pseudoscientific “reality” that would satisfy a not unintelligent, but not scientifically well-versed patron of the attraction. But as I walked the halls of this misguided attraction, I got to thinking:</p>
