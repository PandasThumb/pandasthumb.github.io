<p>It’s a close run thing. I would narrowly give second place to Answers in Genesis, which blames Bryan’s humiliation on <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2025/06/13/partnering-with-faithful-fathers/">his willingness to contemplate an ancient Earth</a>. But first place, to Mike Mueller, writing for <a href="https://www.icr.org/article/scopes-monkey-trial-battle-worldviews/">Creation Research International</a> (CRI), which takes on the interesting task of seeing how well the scientific evidence has held up, gets every single detail wrong, and tells more than the usual number of lies in the process.</p>

<p>Early on: “Eventually the Butler Act was overturned.”</p>

<p>“Eventually” means in 1967! Forty-two years after the trial, seventeen years after the establishment of the National Science Foundation, and six years after the publication of <i>The Genesis Flood</i> led to the resurgence of young Earth creationism. And it was not “overturned,” but repealed. This matters because of ongoing creationist complaints about judicial activism; it was a decision by the State Governor, rather than the outcome of a lawsuit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act">although</a> it was indeed a pending freedom of speech lawsuit that forced the issue.</p>

<p>Once again, it is the birthday (August 1st) of Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de 
Lamarck.  He was the first major evolutionary biologist (as far as I am concerned).  He drew some of 
the first evolutionary trees, and suggested mechanisms for evolution, including adaptation. (His mechanisms 
were wrong, of course).  He was also a major pioneer of invertebrate biology.</p>

<p>On past birthdays I have covered many aspects of Lamarck’s life and work, down to and including the 
avenue and Paris Metro station named after him.  This time, allow me to digress to the life of 
his patron Buffon, who also has a claim to be an early evolutionist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Discovery Institute’s <em>Evolution News</em> website is the foremost site for 
advocacy of Intelligent Design.  We should therefore expect its arguments to 
be technically sound and convincing.  An extraordinary example of their 
standards appeared recently there.  On the 23rd of July, Denyse O’Leary,
who posts there often, explained why: 
<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2025/07/for-darwinism-here-is-the-problem-with-butterfly-mimicry/">For Darwinism, Here Is the Problem with Butterfly Mimicry</a>.</p>

<p>She starts by noting a scientific paper which examined the evolution of 
a type of mimicry in which what look like large eyespots occur near the 
rear end of butterfly wings.  A similar example in butterflyfish will be 
seen in the image above.  These false eyespots might tempt a predator to 
attack that end of the butterfly rather than its actual head.  The 
paper examines such color patterns across many butterfly species, and 
finds that the elements of the pattern evolve together in different 
parts of the evolutionary tree, multiple times.</p>

<p>The authors of that paper conclude that this repeated correlated evolution 
is most likely the result of natural selection for mimicry.
Not so Denyse O’Leary.  She sees a big problem: the fallacy of 
“the five percent solution”.  If the pattern is only five 
percent present, how can it be favored by natural selection?</p>

<p>Charles Darwin (uncredited by O’Leary) gave a convincing 
argument for how eyes in animals could evolve, starting 
with a mere light-sensitive spot.  O’Leary argues that 
no such argument can be made for the false eyespots:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I call this the “five percent solution” because of a question asked in the article at PBS above, “What good is five percent of an eye?” And a reasonable answer is: Some good. Even a light-sensitive spot is better than no vision at all.</p>

  <p><strong>But Now What about the Five Percent Problem?</strong></p>

  <p>The dead leaf butterfly’s challenge — to take one example — is quite different from the one a blind worm faces. The blind worm is better off with five percent of visual information, as opposed to none at all.</p>

  <p>But a method of deception that is only five percent persuasive is not a first step on a road to a solution. Looking only five per cent like a dead leaf would likely prove fatal to the insect that relied on it. The false head butterfly would face the same problem: If the wing spots looked only a bit like a head for aeons, the gradually evolving insect would need a different method of self-protection for quite a long time. And, under the circumstances, why would either the dead leaf or false head mimicry continue to evolve?
There really isn’t an adequate answer to this problem because Darwinian evolution is not thought to show foresight. The usual response has been to Cancel the question instead. That submerges the question but doesn’t make it go away.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not convinced.</p>

<p>This splendid little book (202 pp. not counting the notes) is ostensibly about measles, but it covers a lot more, not least how we are probably unprepared for the next pandemic. I learned two main things: Vaccines do not prevent disease; <i>vaccinations</i> prevent disease. And successful campaigns against contagious diseases contain within them the seeds of their own destruction. The first of these is perhaps obvious; the second, perhaps less so, but once a disease is eradicated or nearly eradicated, people forget, become complacent, possibly exaggerate the side effects of immunization, and sometimes tragically fail to get their vaccinations. Later in the book, the author discusses the libertarian conceit that individual rights take precedence over obligations to others.</p>

<p>But first things first. The book is <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/">Booster Shots</a> by <a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner">Adam Ratner</a>, a specialist in infectious pediatric diseases at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He is also, judging by the contents of his book, a good historian and a talented writer.</p>

Mr. Abrams notes, "This juvenile, judging by size,  Eurasian jay was sheltering in a doorway from attacks by a couple of adult magpies (<i>Pica pica</i>).  Once they’d been driven off it let me approach quite close &ndash; within a couple of metres.  Unsurprisingly, it was panting, so I assume it felt stressed."
