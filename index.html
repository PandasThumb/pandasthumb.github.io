<figcaption> Part of a run of a Dawkins's Weasel simulation,
showing it approaching the target phrase </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>

Eric Holloway has written an article <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/dawkins-dubious-double-weasel-and-the-combinatorial-cataclysm/">here</a> at the Discovery Institute's
 site <em>Mind Matters</em>, in which he presents a variant on Richard
Dawkins's famous Weasel simulation, one in which there is not
just one target phrase, but two.  You may recall that the
original Weasel program had a target phrase, which was "METHINKS
IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".  Counting blanks, this is 28 characters
long.  We start with a random string of 28 characters.  Each
generation the single string of 28 characters produces offspring
and they mutate, each character having a chance of changing to one
of the 26 other possibilities (the alphabet is
26 characters plus a blank).  If there are 10 offspring in each
generation, some may match the target phrase in more positions than other do.
In the original Weasel, natural selection occurs by having the
the offspring closest to the target string
replace the previous parent string.
<p>
In Dawkins's original computer simulation, the target phrase was
found in a few hundred to a few thousand steps, depending on the
number of offspring and the mutation rate.  We can compare this
to what would occur without natural selection, by having
a random offspring string replace the parent string. 
In that case, the string just changes at random by mutation, and
one can show that the number of generations that would be needed
to come across the target phrase would be about 10<sup>40</sup>.
That's an awful lot more than a few thousand.
<p>
Holloway's article claims to show that by using not one, but two
target phrases, it can be seen that natural selection is in most
cases ineffective.  A commenter, "Roy", at Josh Swamidass's
Peaceful Science forum took issue <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/misunderstanding-weasel-programming/14968">here</a> with Holloway.  His argument
there is fairly convincing, but there is more to be said.
<p>
Let me explain ...

<p>They did not exactly do a hatchet job, but Baptist News Global just posted an article, <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/creationism-is-big-business-in-northern-kentucky/#.YmAq2-jMKwU">Creationism is big business in Northern Kentucky</a>, by Mark Wingfield, which is fairly critical of the Ark Park, and indeed draws on an earlier article, <a href="https://ncse.ngo/anti-museum">The Anti-Museum</a>, by our colleague and sometime contributor Dan Phelps. <a href="https://baptistnews.com/more/about/#.YmA2XOjMKwU">Baptist News Global</a> is an independent publication that, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist_News_Global">Wikipedia</a>, is affiliated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Baptist_Fellowship">Cooperative Baptist Fellowship</a>, a relatively liberal denomination that has withdrawn from the Southern Baptist Convention. Mr. Wingfield, the Executive Director of the publication, notes in his article that</p>

<blockquote>creationism has no support in mainstream science. A 2019 Gallup Poll found that 40% of Americans say they believe in creationism, with the likelihood of holding that belief corresponding heavily toward lower levels of education.</blockquote>

<p>At the risk of cherry-picking, he notes further,</p>
<blockquote>Phelps envisioned the museum and life-size ark appealing to home-schooling parents but also wondered if its presence could put a damper on the teaching of accepted science in the region’s schools. He called the teaching of Answers in Genesis “outrageous and remarkable pseudoscience.”</blockquote>

<p>Not a hatchet job, granted, but at least they went after the Ark with a tackhammer.</p>

<p>On the same day, William Trollinger, of the blog Righting America, posted an article, <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-fog-that-enshrouds-ark-encounter/">Ken Ham and the fog that enshrouds Ark Encounter</a>, which outlines the financial shenanigans that accompanied the founding of the Ark Park. Of particular note,</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-government-subsidy-that-makes-ark-encounter-possible/">75% of what Ark Encounter would have paid in property taxes instead goes to paying off the bonds that made the Ark possible</a>. Quite obviously, this is a government subsidy.</blockquote>

<p>According to Mr. Trollinger, the bonds will be fully paid off this month, meaning April. He asks,</p>
<blockquote>[D]oes that mean that, after nine years of this very generous local government subsidy, Ark Encounter will finally begin to pay its fair share of property taxes? </blockquote>

<p>Let us hope so, but anyone who thinks that the Ark Park has brought prosperity to Williamstown needs to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/">We believe in dinosaurs</a>.  Williamstown helped subsidize the Ark Park, but now unfortunately finds itself on the other side of the Interstate highway, a fact that must have been withheld from them when the Ark was begging for subsidies.</p>

<p>Finally, Ken Ham, in his blog, notes on March 26 that there is a labor shortage and proposes <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/issues-facing-ministry/">building dormitories</a> for summer students or, indeed, year-round students whose Christian colleges allow them to study remotely. You do not have to read very deeply between the lines to recognize that he may call these jobs “internships,” which means that he can pay anywhere from $0.00 upward. These interns will of course be a source of cheap labor and will compete with the citizens of Williamstown and elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The head is my gloss on an article, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-04-disbelief-human-evolution-linked-greater.html">Disbelief in human evolution linked to greater prejudice and racism</a>, that was just published on the website Phys.org. It is something of a leap to infer causality, but as we shall see in a moment it is a leap made by the authors of the article. (Incidentally, I put “Darwinism” into scare quotes because I do not believe that evolutionary biology is an -ism.)</p>

<p>At any rate, in brief, Stylianos Syropoulos, a Ph.D. candidate in the War and Peace Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and his colleagues found that in the US and</p>

<blockquote>across the globe—in 19 Eastern European countries, 25 Muslim countries and in Israel—low belief in evolution was linked to higher biases within a person's group, prejudicial attitudes toward people in different groups and less support for conflict resolution.</blockquote>
