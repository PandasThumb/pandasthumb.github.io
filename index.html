<p>Panda’s Thumb readers may recall <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/07/2024-07-12-vitalism-NZ-science_education.html">my 2022 post</a> on the controversy in New Zealand about the the NZ Ministry of Education sticking the concept of “mauri” into the high school Chemistry/Biology curriculum.</p>

<p>As I said at the time, this content was a big problem scientifically, as it was inserting vitalism into basic chemistry. I also made a prediction which some were skeptical of, that it would eventually have to be taken out. In October 2022, Paul Kilmartin, the chemistry professor whose talk I quoted, published a detailed analysis of the issue in <a href="https://nzic.org.nz/unsecure_files/cinz/2022-86-4.pdf">the journal <i>Chemistry in New Zealand</i></a>. <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-im-sticking-up-for-science/">Richard Dawkins</a> and others eventually commented.  In early 2024, <i>Science</i> published a Policy Forum article, by Black and Tyliankankis, “<a href="">Teach Indigenous knowledge alongside science</a>,” which cited Dawkins’s critique and rebutted it by proclaiming the virtues of the Ministry of Education’s policy of “Mana ōrite: equal status for mātauranga Māori.” However, Black and Tyliankankis left out any discussion of Dawkins’s mention of vitalism, or indeed any discussion of the controversy over the mauri/vitalism issue.</p>

<p>I viewed this as pretty misleading, especially because in late 2022 the Ministry of Education’s mana ōrite began to come crashing down, at least for science education. Mauri and a variety of other material was stripped out, the schedule for the rollout of the NCEA Level 1 science curriculum (15-16 year olds) was pushed back by years (it looks like the whole approach is being scrapped by the new government, elected in late 2023; NCEA Levels 2 and 3 have been pushed back by several more years), and several other scandals involving the curriculum reform hit the news in 2023-2024.</p>

<p>To inform <i>Science</i>’s readership about some of the problems, I wrote a response letter which has just been published. Another response was also published by a group of New Zealand scientists and academics (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado6679">Adhar et al. 2024</a>), along with <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9278">a reply from Black and Tylianakis</a>.</p>

<p>I paste the final text of my letter below.</p>

<p><i>(Asides: (1) Unfortunately, some copyediting misadventure occurred after my last look at the proof; I clarify after the main text. (2) I have added the full references for google-ability. (3) If it had been up to me, I would not have italicized “mauri” except for the first non-quoted instance. I follow my preference below.)

A. Black and J. M. Tylianakis ("Teach Indigenous knowledge alongside science," Policy Forum, 9 February, p. 592) give an overly rosy picture of New Zealand's policy of "mana ōrite," or equal status for mātauranga Māori, in science education, which they say teaches Indigenous knowledge "alongside" science rather than "as" science. They suggest that this policy avoids problems such as teaching creationist myths in science class. However, the New Zealand Ministry of Education placed supernatural content directly into science and math curricula with no clarification that it was nonscientific material.

<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Great_Blue_Heron/overview"><i>Ardea herodias herodias</i></a> – great blue heron with red-bellied watersnake <a href="https://herpsofnc.org/red-bellied-watersnake">Nerodia erythrogaster</a>. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "Late afternoon on World Migratory Bird Day last year, having little luck all day, my brother spotted this heron and we realized it had a capture. The snake was still writhing as we attempted to get close enough for a clean shot, and managed it just before the heron flew off with its prey. It's challenging enough for a heron to get a large fish in the right position to swallow whole &ndash; I imagine it's quite a bit harder with something as wickedly aggressive as a watersnake, though we missed that action. There are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_blue_heron">four recognized subspecies of great blue herons</a>, with the possibility of <i>A. h. wardi</i> creeping into the area, but this is much more likely <i>A. h. herodias</i>, as noted. Canon 7D, Tamron SP 150-600 at 600mm, handheld, cropped."

<p>We received only around a dozen submissions this year, and all were very good indeed. In the past, we have polled our readers, but participation in the polls has dropped off. We therefore decided, consistently with Rules 8 and 12, to choose the winners ourselves rather than poll our readers. In this endeavor, we enlisted the assistance of our Wife and Harshest Critic, Deanna, and also our Son the Geek, David. Deanna grew up making dye transfers, and David is a formidable photographer himself. The one thing we three agreed upon was to place Al Denelsbeck’s photograph of what David called “sad snake, happy bird” first. We will announce the runner-up and the bronze medalist, so to speak, in subsequent weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Denelsbeck, who blogs <a href="https://wading-in.net/">here</a>, will be offered his choice between Why Intelligent Design Fails, A Scientific Critique of the New Creationism, edited by Taner Edis and me (and autographed by me); and What’s Gotten Into You by Dan Levitt, generously contributed by NCSE. The runner-up will be offered the remaining book.</p>

<figcaption> Argus 75 twin-lens reflex camera, 1958-1964. It is a fixed-focus camera with a single shutter speed of 1/60&nbsp;s or bulb, and a relative aperture of approximately F/11 or less. It used 620 film and produced a 6&times;6&nbsp;cm negative. It looks like it was a considerable improvement over many box cameras in that it gave a substantially larger image in the viewfinder. Additionally, all the optics is glass. Judging by the little red opening in the back, it was designed for orthochromatic film. I infer from the description of the camera on the <a href="https://www.filmstillphotography.com/argus-75.html">Film Still Photography website</a> that 620 film is no longer available, and you have to buy 120 film and transfer it to a 620 spool. The camera in the photograph, which belonged to my sister-in-law around 1960, no longer works, so we do not have to worry about the film.</figcaption>

<p>The 15th annual Panda’s Thumb Photography Contest begins now, Monday, June 17, at 12:00 p.m., MDT (MDT = UTC(GMT) – 6 h). Entries will be accepted between now and Friday, July 5, at 12:00 p.m., MDT. The rules are precisely the same as previous years’, except, obviously, that the dates have been updated.</p>

<p>We encourage entries in a single, general category, which includes pictures of just about anything of scientific interest: any object of experimentation or observation, from single-celled organisms, through nematodes, fruit flies, rats, chimpanzees, and college sophomores to volcanoes, stars, and galaxies. In order not to omit theoreticians, we will consider computer-generated pictures and also photographs of equipment. Photomicrographs and electron micrographs are likewise welcomed.</p>

<p>Since rumor has it that the pandemic encouraged macro photography, we may, if we receive enough entries, establish a “macro” category.</p>

<p>The winner will receive a choice between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Matt-Young/author/B001HPILDU/">Why Intelligent Design Fails, A Scientific Critique of the New Creationism</a>, edited by Taner Edis and me; and <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/whats-gotten-into-you-dan-levitt">What’s Gotten Into You</a> by Dan Levitt, generously contributed by <a href="https://ncse.ngo/">NCSE</a>. The runner-up will receive the remaining book.</p>
