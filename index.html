<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we are at the last day of 2022, the newspapers are full of accounts of what happened in 2022.  Even the Discovery Institute has bragged, at its site <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/12/the-year-in-review-intelligent-design-grows-in-influence-and-depth/">Evolution News &amp; Science Today</a>
how much the cause of Intelligent Design advanced in the last year.  This account, by Brian Miller, was mocked by critics of ID (e.g. <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/30/the-enduring-futility-of-intelligent-design-creationism/">here</a>).</p>

<p>It is hard to come up with lists of things that happened in 2022.  But much easier to make lists of things that didn’t happen.  I wondered: what are the major things 
that <em>didn’t</em> happen in 2022?  Particularly with regard to arguments for Intellident Design.</p>

<p>I’ll provide my suggested non-event.   It is the clarification of how the Algorithmic Complexity argument for Intelligent Design works.  It remains, as it has been 
for some years, basically unexplained.  A reading of the whole course of argument using Specified Complexity, from William Dembski’s book <em>The Design Inference</em> on, 
shows that the algorithmic complexity calculation started out as a peripheral suggestion and gradually changed until it is now said to be central to that 
argument.  But in the course of these changes, the logic of the criterion became no clearer.</p>

<p>Some time ago I puzzled over this <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html">perhaps at too great a length</a> in a post here at Panda’s Thumb.  Was the algorithm supposed to compute the genotype?  the phenotype? 
Why was observation that it was nonrandomly un-complex supposed to favor ID?  How did the probability distribution of algorithms that was used make biological sense?</p>

<p>Another year has passed, and none of these questions have been answered.  So I nominate this non-event as the greatest non-acheivement of Intelligent Design proponents 
in 2022.  I congratulate them.  But our readers may have other non-achievements to suggest.  Let’s hear from them.</p>

<p>Jerry Coyne on his blog today advises us to <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/29/take-the-faraday-institutes-science-vs-religion-quiz/">Take the Faraday Institute’s Science vs. Religion quiz!</a> So I did! <a href="https://www.sciencereligioncompass.org/">(Here.)</a></p>

<p>You may see my result to the left. I ended up in the fourth quadrant, relatively close to the y-axis. The axis labels are to some extent jargon: Functional means that religion is best at social activities, what Dr. Coyne and I would call “tikkun olam,” or “repairing the world.” Substantive, by contrast, means that religion has meaning or content. The terms on the x-axis are reasonably clear, but I consider scientism to be pejorative and wish they had found a better term. (I have more than once been accused of scientism and am somewhat gratified that I did not land farther to the right.)</p>

<p>Here is what the quiz makers said about me, and it is fairly accurate:</p>

        <p>The New York Times on Sunday ran what I consider a very credulous article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/24/opinion/miracles-neuroscience-proof.html">How Would You Prove That God Performed a Miracle?</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/molly-worthen">Molly Worthen</a>, an historian who, I thought, had not the foggiest idea how you would do so. You may read Jerry Coyne’s takedown of her article <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/12/26/nyt-touts-religious-miracles-as-proof-of-god/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Worthen lets William Dembski get the last word. We have criticized Dr. Dembski seemingly endlessly on this blog, but here I think he’s got it essentially right:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I believe in miracles, but I think they require scrutiny,” Dr. Dembski told me [Dr. Worthen]. “I don’t tend to see things as flamboyant as in the New Testament.” He published a moving <a href="https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/first-person-faith-healing-wheres-the-evidence/">account</a> of his family’s disappointment at a healing revival, where he sought prayer for his autistic son. “There can be quite a bit of self-delusion on the part of people looking for miracles, and it troubles me,” he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Dembski’s family has learned to look for the miraculous in everyday loving encounters, like when a teacher’s aide made it her mission to help his son learn to use the bathroom on his own. “His life is so much better because of this person who wouldn’t give up on him,” he said. “It was no miracle, in terms of a magic wand that touched him and everything was fine. It was people who were willing to love him and do the hard work.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Dembski says he believes in miracles. Or perhaps gives lip service to a belief in miracles. What happened when it got down to brass tacks, as when he took his autistic child to the so-called faith healer? The supposed healer refused to see the child because he did not “look the part”; Dr. Dembski saw right through faith healing and indeed recognized it as “self-delusion.”</p>

<p>I consider a miracle to be a figure of speech for when, say, that teacher takes his son under her wing, does the very best she can with him, and, against the odds, succeeds. Dr. Dembski professes a belief in literal miracles, but seems more impressed with practical, figure-of-speech–type miracles. On that, we can agree.</p>

<h2 id="breakthrough-for-intelligent-design-part-7">Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 7)</h2>

<p>November 13, 2020</p>

<p>by Lars Jon Erkell</p>

<p><strong>Why was the article published?</strong></p>

<p>The publication of Thorvaldsen and Hössjer’s article is embarrassing for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. One could expect the journal to take drastic measures to try to restore its damaged reputation. Like withdrawing the article, firing the responsible editor and blacklisting the reviewers responsible for the scientific review. But they didn’t do that.</p>

<p>Instead, they let the article stand and published a disclaimer from the journal’s management. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments in bona fide universities). We were unaware of this fact while the paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords “intelligent design” were added by the authors after the review process during the proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors. We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the editors distance themselves from ID as such, and say that they did not understand that it was about ID because the keyword “intelligent design” was added by the authors only after the article had been reviewed. That is a strange statement. Firstly, because the editors would not have understood that it was about ID. It is enough to glance quickly through the text to recognize familiar ID themes such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity or Dembski’s explanatory filter. If you happen not to recognize such markers, you should ask yourself what in the world this is all about, and check it out. Failure to understand that this is about creationism/ID shows ignorance and carelessness on a level that is inexcusable for a scientific journal.</p>

<p>Secondly, I believe that it is wrong to reject an article solely for the reason that it deals with ID. It could (theoretically) happen that someone actually managed to find good scientific arguments for ID, and then they should of course be published. That would be a sensation. But, as we saw in the previous post, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have not managed to show anything at all. The statistical method they want to introduce is useless, and consequently they have no results. The article should not have been accepted for publication for the reason that it has no scientific interest. Added to this is all the pseudoscience the article contains.</p>

<p>So why didn’t the journal retract the article, and why did they write this strange disclaimer?</p>
