<figcaption><i>Trioceros jacksonii</i> &ndash; Jackson’s chameleon. Dr. Sturtevant writes, "The Hawaiian islands harbor many unique species of plants and animals that have evolved there while in isolation. But of course humans have introduced many non-native species to the islands, and these foreigners come from around the world. This large chameleon was found along a forested path on Maui, and is one of many species of chameleons that thrive on the islands after having been introduced there through the pet trade and general human stupidity. This large chameleon is quite capable of swallowing baby birds that are in the nest, and so it is a threat to the native birds."

<p>A new article has been published in the illustrious journal <i>BIO-Complexity</i> [sic]:</p>

<blockquote>Burgess, S. (2022). <a href="https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.3">Why the Ankle-Foot Complex Is a Masterpiece of Engineering and a Rebuttal of “Bad Design” Arguments</a>. <i>BIO-Complexity</i>, 2022.</blockquote>

<p>For those not familiar with it, <i>BIO-Complexity</i> [sic] is a journal dedicated to publishing work from the Intelligent Design creationist community. Frustrated by their almost completely futile efforts to get their work or ideas published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, intelligent design proponents took to creating their own journal in 2010 with Douglas Axe as the founding editor-in-chief. Axe was also head of the Biologic Institute, the only research institute dedicated to intelligent design creationism, and the publisher of <i>BIO-Complexity</i> [sic]. The institute <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/biologic-institute-closes.html">has now closed</a>. No word yet on what will happen with the journal, but I imagine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/inteliigent-design-think-tanks-institute-is-a-shutterstock-image/">the green screen</a> has been repurposed. You can read more about the history of the journal <a href="https://ncse.ngo/latest-intelligent-design-journal">here</a>.</p>

<p><i>BIO-Complexity</i> [sic] and The Biologic Institute (and Axe himself to a certain extent), are all funded by the Discovery Institute, the organizing body of the intelligent design creationist movement, which probably needs no introduction to the readers of Panda’s Thumb. But in case you’ve just crawled out of the Olduvai Gorge, you can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute">here</a>.</p>

<p>The new article on the human ankle by Stuart Burgess perfectly aligns with the grand traditions of <i>BIO-Complexity</i> [sic]:</p>

<p>This Kitzmas was different. For the first time, the Discovery Institute allowed the anniversary of 
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District to pass without complaining about the verdict. Perhaps 
they are hoping that we will forget about the incredible badness of the text that they were 
trying to foist on the District’s students. <em>Of Pandas and People</em> is carefully constructed to 
be as misleading as possible, and we shouldn’t let them forget this, as long as contributors 
and advisers responsible for it remain in position within the Discovery Institute<sup>1</sup>, while 
the Institute continues to promote  works such as Denton’s <a href="https://www.discovery.org/v/legacy-of-evolution/?hilite=theory+crisis"><em>Evolution – A Theory in Crisis</em></a>, 
that perpetuate the same elementary errors of logic.  But first, an apparent digression.  When 
students first come across the use of molecular or DNA sequencing in constructing phylogenetic 
trees, they are sometimes puzzled. They have been told that mammals are descended from fish by 
way of amphibians. Therefore, as a matter of common sense, they might expect that frogs should 
be closer to fish in evolutionary terms than we are. This is another example of the Evolution 
as Progress error. While amniotes have progressed through synapsid to mammal to humans, the 
pinnacle of creation, the frog has remained a lowly frog and should, therefore, be closer to 
the common ancestor, as if the ineluctable processes of molecular mutation had somehow been 
suspended.  We might call this the “frozen frog fallacy.”</p>

<p>At this point, a Table like the one shown below might help:</p>

        <p>I consider a miracle to be something that I understand in some detail and know it is impossible, yet there it is in my hand for $200 – a digital camera, for example. I do not understand the James Webb Space Telescope in nearly as much detail, but I still consider it a miracle. <i>Science</i> may not agree with my definition of a miracle, but they consider the telescope the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2022">Breakthrough of the Year</a>. Hard to argue with: the telescope itself is absolutely remarkable, as are some of the images it has returned.</p>

<p><i>Science</i>’s runners-up include perennial rice, the new-found creativity of artificial intelligence, deflection of an asteroid, two advances in virology – a nascent RSV vaccine and the discovery that multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus – and several others. What they call “Breakdowns” are fewer: the fact that zero Covid no longer works (if it ever did), the fact that science ties between nations are “fraying,” and the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions owing to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Answers in Genesis posted a <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/science/year-review-top-science-news-2022/">Year in Review</a>, by Troy Lacey, which they arranged chronologically by month, rather than in order of importance. A few comments below the fold.</p>

<figcaption>Ice crystals on a window during the recent cold snap, December 23, 2022, at around 7:40 a.m. The window is nearly 2&nbsp;m tall and double-paned. It sits behind an insulated Roman shade known as a Warm Window, so it gets very cold near the bottom. The hills are a few millimeters across and melt very quickly once the shade is pulled up.
