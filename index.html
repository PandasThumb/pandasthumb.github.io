<p><i>Paul Braterman is Professor Emeritus in Chemistry, University of North Texas, and Honorary Research Fellow (formerly Reader) at the University of Glasgow. His research has involved topics related to the early Earth and the origins of life, and received support from NSF, NASA, Sandia National Labs, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He is now interested in sharing scientific ideas with the widest possible audience, blogs at <a href="https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/">Primate’s Progress</a>, and is a regular contributor to <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com">3 Quarks Daily</a>, and occasionally to <a href="https://theconversation.com/">The Conversation</a>, where his articles have received more than a million reads.</i></p>

<p>When a scientist who has won awards for his work in the field disagrees with his colleagues, we must ask how much attention we should give to his opinion.</p>

<p>The image you’re looking at is copied from the website of <a href="https://www.drroyspencer.com">Dr Roy Spencer</a>, whose piece was also published by the <a href="https://cornwallalliance.org">Cornwall Alliance</a>. Spencer is a Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, was involved in the development of satellite-based atmospheric temperature monitoring technology for which in 1996 he was <a href="https://www.uah.edu/essc/research/climate">honoured by the American Meteorological Society</a>, and has received funding from NASA, NOAA, and DOE. Yet here he is using gutter tactics to assert that a piece of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300758120">significant new work</a> on the mechanism of climate change is part of an alarmist conspiracy, that the conspiracy is failing to persuade, and that the conspirators are now being forced to invoke arguments based on observations of the stratosphere. Who benefits from this conspiracy and why the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have joined it is not clear
For what it’s worth, acceptance of the reality of the climate crisis is increasing among Americans, as elsewhere, for reasons that are all too obvious, and the smoke of Canadian forest fires is much more persuasive than the scholarly discussion of the stratosphere that has triggered Spencer’s extraordinary reaction.</p>

<p>What is going on? I’m doing my best here to make sense of what is happening, in terms of the development of the disagreements between Spencer and his scientific colleagues, and Spencer’s own personal beliefs, to the extent that these are public knowledge. This is not an <i>ad hominem</i> attack on Spencer’s scientific output, which has been thoroughly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance">criticised</a> elsewhere, but a good faith attempt to understand how he came to his present position.</p>

<p><i><b>Background:</b> <a href="https://biology.williams.edu/profile/lsm1/">Luana Maroja, a biology professor from Williams College</a>, wrote a letter to Brian O’Meara, the past president of the Society of Systematic Biologists about his SSB Presidential talk at the June 2023 Evolution meeting (slides can be found here: <a href="https://brianomeara.info/evol2023.html">https://brianomeara.info/evol2023.html</a>; Evolution 2023 talks are going online here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@evolutionmeetings5042">https://www.youtube.com/@evolutionmeetings5042</a>).  She decided to publish the letter on the Panda’s Thumb site because she is concerned about some of the directions that evolution societies are taking and wants to highlight that reasonable people might have views different from those expressed in O’Meara’s talk.  Luana hopes her letter will start a general discussion.</i></p>

Dear Brian,<br />
<br />

I attended your Presidential talk at the Evolution meeting. I am the person who asked you about selective abortion and embryo selection by polygenic score (“PGS”). I have a few comments, which, I hope, will add a different viewpoint to this discussion.<br />
<br />

In the past, most presidential addresses I attended were motivational – designed to demonstrate and enhance the listeners’ love for evolutionary knowledge and research.  Your talk started this way, too.  But this motivational part was quickly replaced by what seemed to me an attempt to taint Ernst Mayr, setting the stage for a new vote in which his name would finally be removed, replaced by a nameless prize.  Unfortunately, I disagree on several grounds with this idea as well as with other points you made during the talk.

<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-legged_honeycreeper"><i> Cyanerpes cyaneus</i></a> &ndash; Red-legged honeycreeper.  Dr. Harshman writes, "Neotropical honeycreepers belong to the largest bird family, the tanagers, an explosive radiation that includes the Galápagos finches (but none found in the continental USA). Unlike the finches, most tanagers are known for their bright colors. I suspect that the tanager ancestor found its way into South America from the north during or slightly before the Great Faunal Interchange. Hawaiian honeycreepers are a whole separate radiation, descended from some extremely lost flock of fringillid finches."</figcaption>

<p>We received relatively few entries this year from only a few photographers (not all of whom observed rules 3 and 7, incidentally). Consistently with rules 8 and 12, not to mention 11, we have decided not to hold a poll this year, but rather with the assistance of our wife and Professor Steve Steve have carefully chosen a winner and two runners-up. The winning photograph by John Harshman is displayed today. We will display the runners-up on consecutive weeks and then most likely display honorable mentions every other week thereafter. Dr. Harshman will be invited to choose from one of these books: Neil Shubin, <i>Some Assembly Required</i>; Dan Levitt, <i>What’s Gotten Into You?</i>, both generously donated by the National Center for Science Education; or a copy of one of our own books, <i>Why Intelligent Design Fails</i>, <i>No Sense of Obligation</i>, or <i>Why Evolution Works and Creationism Fails</i>.</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/overview"><i>Buteo jamaicensis</i></a> &ndash; red-tailed hawk. I found this juvenile red-tailed hawk sitting on the sidewalk next door and being harassed by a couple of blue jays. While I was out on an errand, my neighbor took her to a rescue place, where they pronounced her to be female, 1.5 months old, and unable to fly yet, but not injured. They will keep her and release her when she can fly. She probably fell out of a nest in a nearby tree, but I saw no sign of parents taking care of her. The blue jays may also have a nest nearby, because they get very agitated when a hawk lands on a telephone pole in the backyard.</figcaption>

<p>Only a few days left to enter the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/06/photography-contest-xiv.html">XIV-th Photography Contest</a>! So dust your cameras, polish your lenses (but do not, God forbid, breathe on them), get out your tripods, zoom lenses, macro lenses, microscopes, and whatnot, even buy film, and submit up to Ⅲ entries to ProfessorSteveSteve@gmail.com. Professor Steve Steve has solemnly promised to forward your submissions promptly. Entries close Friday, July 7 at noon, MDT, and we will announce the finalists at noon, Monday, July 10.</p>

<p>Below the fold, just for fun, a portrait of the hawk and a snapshot of one of the unhappy blue jays. The hawk is just below, on the other side of the fence.</p>
