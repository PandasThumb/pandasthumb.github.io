<p>The funder of the “He Gets Us” ad broadcast during the Super Bowl also funds many groups including Answers in Genesis and the Discovery Institute via dark money techniques.</p>

<p>Several investigators have recently looked into The Servant Foundation because they funded the “He Gets Us” Super Bowl advertisements for Jesus (for example <a href="https://www.au.org/the-latest/articles/christian-nationalist-donors-super-bowl-jesus-ad/">Americans United</a> and <a href="https://skepchick.org/2023/02/whos-behind-those-jesus-ads-youre-gonna-see-during-the-big-game/">Rebecca Watson</a>, aka Skepchick). Both AU and Skepchick discovered that, in spite of the liberal-sounding nature of the Super Bowl advertising, the Servant Foundation also has donated to numerous fundamentalist Christian Nationalist hate groups. Apparently, the Servant Foundation is a “<a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds">donor-advised fund</a>” and receives donations for a number of worthy causes as well as cringeworthy hateful groups. Because of loopholes in the tax laws, people can donate to the Servant Foundation and see that their money goes to their favorite extremist groups via a “donor-advised fund” without their identity being revealed; this is basically “dark-money.”</p>

I saw a zillion of these rather undistinguished looking creatures fluttering all over the rabbitbrush, so naturally I photographed some. They seem to be far more common in the eastern part of the United States, but there is an interesting concentration in Colorado between Fort Collins and Colorado Springs, according to <a href="https://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species/Helicoverpa-zea?page=6">Butterflies and Moths of North America</a>, presumably because that is where all the people live. Something like 70 years ago, I learned that moths had furry antennas and butterflies had smooth antennas, so I first thought, against all odds, that these were butterflies (is the "furry" simply microscopic?). Fortunately, the Library of Congress asks (and answers), <a href="https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/zoology/item/how-can-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-butterfly-and-a-moth/"> How can you tell the difference between a butterfly and a moth?</a> which notes several distinguishing features, not just one.

<p>We recently learned of an article, <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/why-creationism-may-come-back-to-our-schools">Why Creationism May Come Back to Our Schools</a>, by Eugenie Scott, the former director of the <a href="https://ncse.ngo/">National Center for Science Education</a>. The occasion was a talk presented by Dr. Scott to the Humanist Society of Santa Barbara on February 1 and ably reported by Robert Bernstein for <a href="https://www.edhat.com/">Edhat</a>, an online newspaper that covers Santa Barbara County, California.</p>

<p>You may read Mr. Bernstein’s article for yourself; let it suffice to say that Dr. Scott reviews “many decades of cases” regarding the Establishment Clause and discusses why creationism generally fails. Then, she says, we come to the Kennedy case, wherein the Supreme Court overruled lower-court decisions and ruled that an assistant football coach, Joseph Kennedy, will be allowed to pray at the center of the football field with his students. The decision is troubling because the new right-wing Supreme Court has no trouble overruling previously established decisions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jerry Coyne tells us, 
<a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/02/09/montana-considers-bill-that-allows-teaching-of-scientific-fcts-but-not-scientific-theories/">Montana considers a bill that allows teaching of “scientific facts” but not “scientific theories”</a>. Prof. Coyne is the proprietor of the popular blog <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com ">Why Evolution Is True</a> and, as they say, has read the bill so you and I do not have to.</p>

<img src="/uploads/2023/Trollinger_Ark_Attendance_900.jpg" alt="Graph" />
<figcaption> Actual Ark attendance vs. projected, based on the data of William Trollinger. The actual attendance in Year 1 seems to be an estimate. Actual attendance for the period March 2020 through February 2021 have been omitted owing to Covid. Actual attendance for the period January through June 2023 is an estimate based on the historical ratio of attendance during the first six months of the year to that of the last six months.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>William Trollinger, on the blog Righting America, presents what he calls a few facts about Ark Encounter attendance and deems that attendance to be <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/not-even-close-to-what-was-projected-a-few-facts-about-ark-encounter-attendance/">Not Even Close to What Was Projected</a>. Dr. Trollinger bases his conclusion on data acquired by the indomitable Dan Phelps, an occasional guest contributor here at PT. Mr. Phelps each month uses the Kentucky Open Records Act to ascertain the monies collected by the city of Williamstown from the safety fee of $0.50 added to each ticket. From these data it is easy to deduce the number of tickets sold and therefore the number of patrons in any given month, apart from a number of possibly fictitious season-pass holders who pass the ticket window without being assessed the safety fee.</p>

<p>I have graphed Dr. Trollinger’s data and show them as the frontispiece to this article. Two of the years, as noted, are estimates. Year 4 is actually a two-year period from July 2019 to June 2021, but with March 2020 through February 2021 omitted because of the Covid pandemic. The result does not seem out of line. Overall attendance, over the 6 years, is about 40 % of projected attendance and appears to have fallen somewhat since Year 3, as projected attendance rises.</p>

<p>For that, as Dr. Trollinger notes, Williamstown issued $62 million in junk bonds and in effect forwent a significant sum in property taxes. For more details, see the original article.</p>
