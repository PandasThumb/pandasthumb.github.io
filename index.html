<figcaption> Actual Ark attendance vs. projected, based on the data of William Trollinger. The actual attendance in Year 1 seems to be an estimate. Actual attendance for the period March 2020 through February 2021 have been omitted owing to Covid. Actual attendance for the period January through June 2023 is an estimate based on the historical ratio of attendance during the first six months of the year to that of the last six months.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>William Trollinger, on the blog Righting America, presents what he calls a few facts about Ark Encounter attendance and deems that attendance to be <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/not-even-close-to-what-was-projected-a-few-facts-about-ark-encounter-attendance/">Not Even Close to What Was Projected</a>. Dr. Trollinger bases his conclusion on data acquired by the indomitable Dan Phelps, an occasional guest contributor here at PT. Mr. Phelps each month uses the Kentucky Open Records Act to ascertain the monies collected by the city of Williamstown from the safety fee of $0.50 added to each ticket. From these data it is easy to deduce the number of tickets sold and therefore the number of patrons in any given month, apart from a number of possibly fictitious season-pass holders who pass the ticket window without being assessed the safety fee.</p>

<p>I have graphed Dr. Trollinger’s data and show them as the frontispiece to this article. Two of the years, as noted, are estimates. Year 4 is actually a two-year period from July 2019 to June 2021, but with March 2020 through February 2021 omitted because of the Covid pandemic. The result does not seem out of line. Overall attendance, over the 6 years, is about 40 % of projected attendance and appears to have fallen somewhat since Year 3, as projected attendance rises.</p>

<p>For that, as Dr. Trollinger notes, Williamstown issued $62 million in junk bonds and in effect forwent a significant sum in property taxes. For more details, see the original article.</p>

<p>The answer to the titular question depends on what you think they are designed for; hence, it seems to be a silly question. When it comes to the eyes, however, there is little doubt: human (and other vertebrate) retinas are in backward in that nerves, blood vessels, and other structures are piled on top of the photoreceptors and thus reduce sensitivity, if not resolution. Additionally, the nerves go out through a hole in the retina, which makes us susceptible to glaucoma. Cephalopod retinas, by contrast, face forward, with nothing covering the photoreceptors, and the nerves do not have to pass through a hole in the retina. Cephalopod eyes are thus clearly better designed than human eyes.</p>

<p>I raise this question by way of introducing an article, <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2022/12/the-night-begins-to-shine-the-tapetum-lucidum-and-our-backward-retinas/">The night begins to shine: The tapetum lucidum and our backward retinas</a>, by Nathan H. Lents, in the January-February issue of <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i>. The tapetum lucidum, or just tapetum, is a reflective membrane in the retinas of many nocturnal vertebrates and is located just behind the photoreceptors. Its purpose is presumedly to direct the light that the photoreceptors miss back into them and thereby increase the sensitivity. Interestingly, tapetums composed of many different materials appear to have evolved many different times in different creatures. Cephalopods have no tapetum, presumably because their retinas face forward, with the photoreceptors directly facing the light. Prof. Lents explains all this and more in great but easily understandable detail.</p>

<p><i><strong>Update</strong>, January 28, 2023, 3:30 p.m., MST. A version of this post appeared in the Lexington (Kentucky) Herald-Leader under the head <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article271570602.html">Creation Museum to host anti-abortion event with extremist pastor, Ky legislators | Opinion</a>. Mark Looy replied under the head <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article271724962.html ">Abortion clarification</a>. You may see the text of his letter in <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/01/ken-ham-using.html#comment-6101095162">Comment 6101095162</a>. Mr. Phelps replies there that Mr. Looy’s reply “seems to concede what I said, but tries to obfuscate. He admits that the legislation would cause women that have abortions be charged with murder and that Pastor Jeff Durbin advocates the death penalty.”</i></p>

<p>Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis (AiG), along with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/02/27/hipster-says-he-wants-to-execute-women-who-have-abortions-6475717/">the extremist Jeff Durbin</a> of Arizona’s Apologia Church, are hosting a political event for pastors at the Creation Museum to support <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lyiv2zQr6k">pending Kentucky anti-abortion legislation</a>.  To my knowledge <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/23rs/index_headings.html">this legislation has not yet been introduced</a> as of January 18. The rally is also advertised on January 18, AiG’s weekly “Answers News”, near the end of the show (<a href="https://youtu.be/AUkCdwY6LVs">about 34 minutes in</a>).</p>

<p>Back in March 2007, when the Creation Museum was about to open, AiG’s Mark Looy and Ken Ham penned a post to their website titled “<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/world-religions/humanism/goose-stepping-to-zion/">Goose-stepping to Zion</a>.”    This essay claims AiG is “apolitical” and states:</p>

<figcaption><i>Trioceros jacksonii</i> &ndash; Jackson’s chameleon. Dr. Sturtevant writes, "The Hawaiian islands harbor many unique species of plants and animals that have evolved there while in isolation. But of course humans have introduced many non-native species to the islands, and these foreigners come from around the world. This large chameleon was found along a forested path on Maui, and is one of many species of chameleons that thrive on the islands after having been introduced there through the pet trade and general human stupidity. This large chameleon is quite capable of swallowing baby birds that are in the nest, and so it is a threat to the native birds."
