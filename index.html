        <p><i>Summary: Ken Ham is being quiet that Answers in Genesis (AIG) owns part, or perhaps all, of the new Hampton Inn that just opened adjacent to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky. Moreover, he is trying to make it look as if the supposed “success” of the Ark Park has brought the new hotel to the region. Information below shows that AIG shares a high-level employee with the new hotel, and the LLC that owns the hotel shares a Post Office box with AIG.</i></p>

<p>Ken Ham is being quiet on who owns the new <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/cvgarhx-hampton-suites-williamstown-ark-encounter/"> Hampton Inn hotel</a> next to the Ark. It turns out that AIG is, in all probability, at least a partial owner. AIG has not stated their financial interest publicly.  How long will Ham keep quiet about AIG being a part-owner, or more, of the new hotel?</p>

<p>On March 5, Ken Ham bragged that <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2023/03/05/new-hotel-opens-next-to-ark-encounter/">a new hotel was being built next to the Ark Park parking lot</a>. Ken was proud that he and select AIG staff were “offered” and given a tour of a new Hampton Inn hotel. It was not stated, but implied, that a new business, independent from AIG and Ark Encounter, was being brought to the region by the overwhelming success of the Ark. His tour is implied to have been given by an unnamed owner.</p>

<p>The address of this new Hampton Inn is 2 Skyway Drive, Williamstown, KY. According to the free portion of the Grant County PVA (Property Valuation Administrator) site, this property is owned by Great Tourism Hospitality, LLC (GTH) of Bellevue, Kentucky (Figure 1).</p>

<p>“P hacking” is a form of cheating, whether inadvertent or advertent.  You test a bunch of chemicals on rats to see whether they cause, say weight loss.  You do a statistical 
test on each, to see whether there is significant evidence for weight loss.  The 
results are judged by the probability <em>P</em> that evidence this strong would arise by 
chance, if there were actually no effect.  You use a small probability, say 0.05, 
as a sign that the effect is real.  But suppose that you have 100 different chemicals, and do 100 separate tests.  If none of these chemicals have any actual effect, what 
is the chance that none of the tests will have <em>P</em> smaller than 0.05?</p>

<p>That is easy to compute: it is 0.95<sup>100</sup>, which is 0.00592.  The chance that at least one of the 100 tests shows a value of <em>P</em> below 0.05 is actually 0.99408.  If what you do is pick that test (or tests) and write a scientific paper reporting the 
effectiveness of that chemical, you will be committing P-hacking.  If none of the 
chemicals actually works, over 99% of the time you will be able to announce that you have found a weight-loss drug.</p>

<p>All that is relevant to evaluating the meaning of a mathematical paper in the ID journal <em>BIO-Complexity</em> in 2018.  It is by George Montañez, a computer scientist at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California.  It contains mathematical proofs that concepts of Specified Complexity can be considered in a unified way.  The unstated 
implication is that with natural evolutionary processes, high levels of Specified Complexity cannot be expected.  Montañez’s paper can be found 
<a href="https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2018.4/BIO-C.2018.4">here</a>.</p>

<p>Why am I bringing up P-hacking?  Not to accuse Montañez of it.  In fact, the 
opposite.  It is to point out that natural selection acts like P-hacking. 
Let me explain, first what Montañez’s paper does, then what it says about demonstrating Design, 
and finally how natural selection’s “P hacking” makes that difficult:</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mantis">Tenodera_sinensis</a> – Chinese mantids emerging from egg sac, or ootheca. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "I have yet to capture the actual emergence, but this is not long afterward. They appear to do an immediate molt, or perhaps partial molt, while still attached to a fine thread, but from what I've been able to observe the legs aren't included in the fragments left behind, so perhaps one of the more entomological readers can clarify. Within the hour, that bulging forehead will shrink, the eyes will swell, and the classic mantis head will become apparent, as the legs begin to gain mobility. Some already-mobile siblings can be made out in the background. There is also a brief video [and additional photographs] to accompany this, found at <a href="http://wading-in.net/walkabout/2017/04/too-cool-part-35-a-modicum-of-success/">http://wading-in.net/walkabout/2017/04/too-cool-part-35-a-modicum-of-success/</a>." We think you will not be disappointed if you follow the link; the video is near the bottom of the page, following a half-dozen still photos.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Frank Lovell, an outstanding defender of evolution and promoter of public understanding of science, died on January 26, 2023, from injuries suffered in a fall. He was 79 years old. He is survived by his wife Debbie and children Annie Lovell, Frank Lovell III, Alicia Lovell (Dennis Nalley) and Simon Lovell (Sneha Thapa) (1).</p>

<p>Born in Ashland Kentucky, he served four years in the United States Army. He then studied physical organic chemistry at the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky, receiving a bachelor’s degree from the latter. A 30-year career with General Electric in Louisville followed.</p>

<p>Frank’s anti-creationism efforts began in 1982 with letters to the editor; he estimated that he wrote a couple of dozen letters in the next couple of years (2). In 1983, I had a letter of my own published, critiquing a creationist op-ed. A couple of days later, I received a letter from Frank, praising my letter and including a copy of the letter he had written personally to the creationist. He invited me to join him in fighting creationism. This was the beginning of an extensive collaboration that would continue until I moved away from Louisville in 2006.</p>
