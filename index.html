<p>According to the Pew Research Center, confidence in scientists has ticked up slightly, though it remains lower than it was before the pandemic. That is one of the conclusions of a report, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">Public Trust in Scientists and Views on Their Role in Policymaking</a>, by Alec Tyson and Brian Kennedy. Pew surveyed nearly 10,000 US adults in October and discovered that Americans (mostly) perceive scientists as intelligent, honest, and focused on real-world problems. They see communication as a weak area and think that we are good at working in teams, though how they know about teamwork is a puzzle to me.</p>

<p>At least they think we are reasonably bright; they also find us socially awkward, cold, superior, and closed-minded. Figure 1 shows how these perceptions break down according to political party: Democrats and their fellow travelers (whom I shall call Democrats) have a considerably more favorable view of scientists than Republicans and their fellow travelers (whom I shall call Republicans). I was somewhat bemused by the claim of roughly half of Republicans that scientists "[d]on't pay attention to moral values of society," and wondered precisely what and whose moral values they have in mind.</p>

<p>Pew notes, somewhat to my surprise,</p>

<img src="/uploads/2024/Roberts_Every_Living_Thing_Cover_600.jpg" alt="Book cover" />
<figcaption><a href=""></a>The cover is kind of "busy," but I shall try not to judge the book by its cover.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The book is <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7TNQHKK/">Every Living Thing</a>, The Great and Deadly Race to Know All Life</i>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Roberts_(author)">Jason Roberts</a>. It is sort of a double biography of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788), but it continues to follow their legacies well beyond their lifetimes to the present. I cannot recommend it more highly.</p>

<p>I do not know what impression Mr. Roberts intended, but if you thought Linnaeus was a young man on the make, something of a scoundrel who might say anything in the interests of self-promotion, you might not be too far from the truth. The hero of this book is not Linnaeus but rather his sometime rival, Buffon.</p>

<p>But let us deal with Linnaeus first. Linnaeus obtained a phony doctor’s degree from what we would now call a diploma mill. He anointed 14 (or <a href="https://www.ikfoundation.org/books-and-art/linnaeus-apostles-full-set/">17</a>
 of what he called his “apostles” (!), sent them on long journeys from which many never returned, and completely abandoned one who returned with no specimens. He has been criticized for not allowing his daughters their educations, to a degree, says Roberts, that was extreme even for the time (but he supported his daughter Elisabeth in her interest in botany. She wrote a paper devoted to what is now known as the <a href="https://www.nybg.org/blogs/science-talk/2013/12/flashes-in-the-twilight/">Elizabeth Linnaeus phenomenon</a>). Linnaeus also believed in the fixity of species, not to mention some very bizarre creatures, but in that he was probably not alone.</p>

<p>Linnaeus developed a taxonomy that is largely in use today; that is a major accomplishment, to say the least. After defining and then apparently rejecting some ridiculous species within the genus <i>Homo</i>, he divided <i>Homo sapiens</i> into four subspecies: in essence, European, African, indigenous American, and Asian. Europeans, to Linnaeus, were governed by laws, whereas Africans were governed by whim, Americans by customs, and Asians by opinions. Roberts notes that “apologists have attempted to absolve Linnaeus of racism,” but he insists that claiming that Europeans alone were governed by laws is a clear statement of superiority. He cannot forgive Linnaeus, who stood by these characterizations for the rest of his life. I do not know whether Roberts is engaging in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(historical_analysis)">presentism</a>, but I suspect not.</p>

a design inference? <em>Wikimedia, public domain</em></div></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2024/06/dembskiewert1.html">post of 12 June</a>, I commented on the first part of William 
Dembski and Winston Ewert’s new book, the second edition of Dembski’s 
1998 book <em>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance 
Through Small Probabilities</em>.   I noted that to make the argument 
for a Design Inference they had set aside Dembski’s previous criterion 
of Complex Specified Information, and instead replaced it by 
Algorithmic Specified Complexity (ASC).</p>

<p>This is a measure of the difference between the length of a bitstring and the length of a bitstring that describes it. 
It originates from the mathematical work on “randomness deficiciency”, where the bitstring is a binary number, and the smaller bitstring is a computer program that computes it.  In that field, numbers that are considered truly random are those generated by programs that are almost as long as the number.  A number that can be generated by a short program is not considered random.</p>

<p>Dembski and Ewert intend to apply this to biology.  The longer number somehow specifies a phenotype (or maybe a 
genotype), while the shorter number “describes” it.  In my previous review, I had reached Chapter 7, “Evolutionary Biology”.  Here, let’s consider how they argue the ASC criterion can be applied to biological adaptations.  (Spoiler – we’re going to be disappointed).</p>
