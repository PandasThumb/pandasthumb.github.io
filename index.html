<p>I have been reading, intermittently, I afraid, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JBJS1MF/"> An Immense World</a>, subtitled “How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,” by Ed Yong. The book is about senses: vision, touch, pain, hearing, but also heat, vibration, electric and magnetic fields, and echoes and echolocation. I am about up to the part where he tries to tell you, with a sort of apology to Thomas Nagel, what it is like to be a bat.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I heard Mr. Yong interviewed by Arielle Duhaime-Ross last week on Science Friday, under the title, <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/an-immense-world-umwelt-animals/">Expanding our Umwelt: Understanding animal experiences</a>. <i>Umwelt</i> is a German word that Mr. Yong borrows to mean “the part of [its] surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world.”</p>

<p>Additionally, <i>The New York Times</i> ran an article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/animals-vision-video.html">A bird’s-eye view of a Technicolor world</a>, by Emily Anthes. This article shows some videos supposedly demonstrating what the world might look like to a bird whose vision is sensitive to ultraviolet light. There seemed to be an implicit assumption that ultraviolet looked a lot like violet and the birds see the primary colors about the same as we do, but never mind.</p>

<p>Darwin Day, that is, the anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth in 1809, is February 12. If you are sponsoring any Darwin Day events, or indeed if you know of any, please submit them to <a href="https://darwinday.org/">International Darwin Day</a>. As I write, only a half-dozen events are listed, and I am sure that there are many more.</p>

        <p>The ever-vigilant Dan Phelps has sent us a couple of links from West Virginia, where their Senate education committee <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/senate-education-committee-approves-intelligent-design-in-curriculum-national-motto-display-in-schools-and-adjusted/article_fd8cd01e-b49b-11ee-88d8-4fdacea07ccf.html">approved a bill</a> that would allow the teaching of intelligent-design creationism in the public schools. The WV News noted that</p>

<blockquote><p>The new bill would allow teachers to discuss theories about the origins of the universe or life. School boards, superintendents, or principals wouldn't be able to prevent teachers from discussing these topics.</p>

<p>The idea for the intelligent design bill came from a science teacher. This teacher wanted to discuss intelligent design in their class, but they were worried about the possible consequences. They stated that intelligent design isn't based on religion. Instead, it's the thought that a conscious entity designed the universe. This belief doesn't dispute the theory of evolution's explanation of the universe's origins. The bill aims to promote fair education by supporting free speech, religious freedom, and not being prejudiced against people's beliefs. </p></blockquote>

<p>Note the buzzwords, free speech and religious freedom. We hope that the incorrect assertion that the theory of evolution explains the origin of the universe was due to the reporter and not the science teacher. We are bemused by the idea that intelligent-design creationism is not based on religion, yet should be taught in the name of religious freedom.</p>

<p>According to WV Public Broadcasting, <a href="https://wvpublic.org/lawmakers-hear-support-for-intelligent-design-in-public-schools/">two high school students</a>, Haden Hodge and Hunter Bernard, argued that intelligent-design creationism is not a religious argument. Mr. Hodge said that intelligent design</p>

<blockquote>is not a religious argument. I am not advocating for Biblical Creationism, or Adam and Eve, or the Muslim and Jewish narrative. This is not a biblical argument.</blockquote>

<p>Odd that he said he was not advocating for the Muslim and Jewish narrative, yet left out the Christian narrative. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Bernard further testified that teachers were prohibited from teaching about a designer and feared repercussions if they did.</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps, who is from Kentucky and has been fighting this kind of nonsense for years, adds, “Let us hope that this doesn’t spread to Kentucky; our legislature would fall for ID creationism very quickly.”</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Added February 2, 2024, at about 10:00 MDT:</strong></p>

<p>It appears as though the answer to the initial question, “Is intelligent-design creationism making a comeback?” may be a qualified “Yes.” Specifically, <a href="https://ncse.ngo/catalyzing-action/sign-ncse-monitor">NCSE Monitor</a>, a weekly newsletter published by the <a href="https://ncse.ngo/"> National Center for Science Education</a>, today noted several “intelligent design” bills besides those in West Virginia:</p>

<ul><li> <a href="https://ncse.ngo/maines-problematic-proposed-revisions-science-standards-under-fire">Maine</a>: A proposal to encourage middle school <i>science</i> teachers to teach about genocide, eugenics, and the Holocaust. Maybe we should "encourage" middle school history teachers to teach evolution. </li>

<li><a href="https://ncse.ngo/mandatory-intelligent-design-bill-oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>: A Senate bill to require public or charter school teachers to teach "the concepts of creationism and/or intelligent design" if they teach evolution. NCSE points out that teaching "intelligent design" has been deemed unconstitutional by a Federal court because it is a religious view [quotation marks in original]. Two <a href="https://ncse.ngo/two-intelligent-design-bills-oklahoma">similar bills have been prefiled in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. &lt;/li&gt;

<li>And finally, <a href="https://ncse.ngo/west-virginias-former-intelligent-design-bill-passes-senate">West Virginia</a>: According to NCSE, the Senate bill has passed and now states that "[n]o public school board, school superintendent, or school principal shall prohibit a public school classroom teacher from discussing or answering questions from students about scientific theories of how the universe and/or life came to exist."</li>&lt;/ul&gt;

Stay tuned!

        <p>At the start of this year, Answers in Genesis completed moving their K-12 Answers Academy school into the $31 million former Toyota USA Headquarters building in northern Kentucky. Where they received to money to purchase the building has been a bit of a mystery, considering the lackluster ticket sales at the Ark Encounter. Today I discovered <a href="https://readlion.com/answers-academy-celebrates-new-facility-expanded-enrollment/">this story</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, The Herzog Foundation bankrolled some of the renovations that made the school’s present location possible. The article says: “The school renovations were made possible in part by a grant from The Herzog Foundation, which publishes The Lion.”</p>

<p>A further search about The Herzog Foundation brings up <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/08/dark-money-group-pushing-woke-heat-maps-targeting-schools-has-ties-to-christian-education-foundation/">this article</a>, which shows the Herzog Foundation is associated with several extremist far-right groups funneling dark money into so-called “anti-woke” schools.</p>

<p>AIG may have numerous dark money groups financing the Ark, Creation Museum, and their other activities, while simultaneously receiving $1.825 million a year as sales tax rebate incentives from the Kentucky Tourism Cabinet.</p>
