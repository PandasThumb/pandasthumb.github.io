<p>This article, <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/geology/how-long-have-arches-been-around/">How Long Have Arches Been Around?</a>, by <i>Dr</i>. Danny Faulkner, describes creationist “research” into geomorphology. It is laughably bad, even for creationists. Natural arches and bridges are aesthetically interesting, but are only a tiny part of some geomorphology studies.</p>

<p>In this piece, Dr. Faulkner* extrapolates backward to “show” that arches in Arches National Park, Utah, have formed since Noah’s Flood, about 4,500 years ago. He claims this timeframe because of</p>

<ul><li>Biblical literalism. Employees of Answers in Genesis must sign a <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/">Statement of Faith</a> that posits that the earth and universe are 6,000 years old, and that most geology is a result of Noah’s Flood, approximately 4,500 years ago. </li>

<li>An exponential rate of arch collapse.  Faulkner states he doesn’t use a linear decline in numbers of arches because no arches would remain after 4,500 years. No consideration is given to the possibility of much longer time scales, or changes in climate and erosion rates. Change in regional climates over time is ignored, possibly because the young earth creationists at AIG cram the nearly 2 million years of Pleistocene glacial maxima into a single ice age of only 200 years after the Flood. </li></ul>

<p>Conveniently, AiG uses this denial of the Pleistocene to also ignore evidence for past climate changes and the evidence scientists use to support anthropogenic climate change in the present. Faulkner has invented his model by assuming that an exponential model is the best for arch collapse, and then he fits things assuming the rate is 43 arches in 29 years.</p>

<p>However, his scholarship is abysmally shoddy. Conceivably, it would be possible to make a plot of cumulative arches lost vs. time. This would be a more accurate method for modeling. However, Faulkner just assumes the loss rate was constant (a cumulative arches-vs.-time chart would show the accuracy of that assumption).</p>

<p>He also seems to assume that the collapse of arches in Utah is related solely to the minerals cementing the sandstone that the arches are formed from. He doesn’t document any effort to examine records to see if any collapses were associated with long term climate changes, intense storms, seismic events, vandalism, and innumerable other possible causes.</p>

<p>Faulkner also assumes a uniform rate of arch formation. He then uses his model and that assumption to show that, in his view, there would have been an implausible number of arches if the Earth were as old as earth scientists claim.</p>

<p>All his equations are a smoke screen, an appeal to look like scientific research when religious apologetics is what is actually being presented. In short, this is a parody of how science is actually done. The 4,500 year time frame and the Flood are required by AIG’s  peculiar version of a “Biblical Worldview,” which is more than a bit of a science stopper and a weird excuse to start with creationist conclusions and work backwards.</p>

<p>Dr. Faulkner oddly discusses Kentucky arches in Red River Gorge in addition to Arches National Park, but cannot do a similar calculation for the Kentucky arches, as arch collapse here in Kentucky has not been documented. The reported observations in Kentucky are another smoke screen in the article, basically a non sequitur. The discovery/documentation rate of arches in Kentucky has no bearing on their rate of formation or collapse (and the same holds for Utah).</p>

<p>Dr. Faulkner’s apparent assumption that the evolution of arches from formation to collapse is naive. Surely, the height, span, and dimensions of the suspended material are factors to consider. Not all arches are formed in the same fashion: some are formed by wind or water erosion; some by collapse. Not all arches are in the same topographic position: some are isolated and exposed on points; some are parallel to cliff faces. The relationship to and importance of natural fracturing differs among arches. If Dr. Faulkner considered these factors, he didn’t document his efforts. Our assumption is that he was unaware of these complications or deliberately chose to ignore them (and didn’t document why he did so).</p>

<p>The nonscientific method used by Answers in Genesis “researchers” results in the publication of materials that don’t reflect reality very well; yet AiG’s conclusions are held by millions of our fellow citizens. Faulkner’s piece is a <i>dazzle-them-with-sciency-sounding-stuff faux research that confirms AIG and their audience’s preexisting biases</i>. The public deserves better. It should be part of our job as earth scientists to do a better job of explaining science to the public</p>

<hr />

<p>*Faulkner’s Ph.D. is in astronomy; he works as a researcher for Answers in Genesis. He has some family ties to the region and occasionally has led paid AiG creationist hiking tours of Red River Gorge and its arches.</p>

<p><strong>Appendix</strong>. If you are interested in Kentucky geology, <a href="https://www.uky.edu/KGS/geoky/fieldtrip/2005%20NaturalBridge%20red%20river%20gorge%20guide.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.uky.edu/KGS/geoky/fieldtrip/2010%20Guidebook%20natural%20bridge%20guidebook.pdf">here</a> are field guides to the Red River Gorge area written by geologists (and you can use these guidebooks to visit the public sites for free!). The Kentucky Geological Survey has a <a href="https://kgs.uky.edu/arches/">project and map service</a> dedicated to Kentucky arches for the hiking public. (Arches on private land are generally excluded from this database.)</p>

<p><i>The original title of this article, borrowed (as you may infer) from Ken Ham, was "Here's What People NEED To Know about Ken Ham." That title now seems too cute and did not seem to give the article much traction, so we have taken the unusual step of changing it to the present, more descriptive title. The URL remains the same. </i></p>
<p><br />
Ken Ham, on a YouTube video entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/1aGZoJCdCpo?si=8iLpBwawPiOYOYbE">Here’s What People NEED to Realize about Kamala Harris</a>” and specifically credited to Answers in Genesis, explicitly attacks Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris for her views on abortion and other matters. The video received around 150,000 views in a day or so. AIG writes,</p>

<blockquote><p>"In this short video, Ken Ham speaks on the recent political ideologies of Kamala, sharing his perspective on them as a Bible-believing Christian." [Note how he infantilizes her by using her first name only.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Our colleague Dan Phelps, who sent us this link, asks, “How is AIG, a ministry, still tax exempt?” He notes that AIG’s shell company, Ark Encounter, gets $1.825 million per year in sales tax rebates from Kentucky Tourism and is advertised for free by the taxpayer-supported “Kentucky Faith Trail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps suggests that you can complain to the IRS using <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf">Form 13909, Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint (Referral)</a>. It is not clear whether the IRS will take any action, but a few complaints cannot hurt. AIG’s street address is Answers in Genesis, 2800 Bullittsburg Church Rd., Petersburg, KY 41080, and their EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is 33-0596423.  You need to send a cover letter along with the form, but both may be e-mailed to the address at the bottom of page 1.</p>

<p>The IRS form asks you for “Who/What/Where/When/How you learned about and obtained the information in this report.” I do not know precisely what approach to take, beyond that Mr. Ham runs a tax-exempt religious organization, which he considers a ministry, and in this video he is implicitly campaigning against Kamala Harris. Perhaps this line of reasoning can be fleshed out in the comments to this post. The URL of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGZoJCdCpo.</p>

<p>In case you have the illusion that Mr. Ham is not electioneering, I can assure you that his minions think otherwise. Consider, for example, these (admittedly cherry-picked) comments:</p>

This particular light is optimized for mineral identification by selectively emitting two different wavelengths of light (UV-A, 365&nbsp;nm, and UV-C, 245&nbsp;nm), while filtering out all of the visible light. Everything  in this photo is either fluorescing or illuminated from the emitted light of the fluorescent minerals. Recent studies suggest that this cave passage has remained little changed for the past 12 million years."

<p>Who knew? I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, the inability to visualize things. Well, probably not fully fledged aphantasia, but certainly <i>dys</i>phantasia. Aphantasia is a word I first learned on listening to an NPR program with a somewhat lengthy title, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/26/1198910315/face-blindness-prosopagnosia-memory-aphantasia-sight-imagination">The human brain is hardwired to recognize faces. But what if you can’t?</a> It turns out that Sadie  Dingfelder, the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316545147/">Do I Know You? A Faceblind Reporter’s Journey into the Science of Sight, Memory, and Imagination</a>, can’t. Recognize faces, that is.</p>

<p>Ms. Dingfelder is not only face blind; she is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoblindness">stereo blind</a> and aphantasic. Now, I understand that freshman psychology students think they suffer from every affliction they study, but I was surprised to find that I have some degree of all of those.</p>
